When you go to a doctor for pain, they might take an x-ray, CT scan, or MRI of
you to help with the diagnosis. Doctors then look at the results of the imaging
and map certain characteristics to a diagnosis. Similar to how the medical world
has these tests for humans, web developers have diagnostic tests to help them
determine issues with websites. One of the most popular ones, Chrome DevTools,
contains a plethora of helpful tools to help diagnose problems including the
ability to profile the runtime performance of websites.

In this post, we'll use the performance panel of Chrome DevTools to diagnose
several common performance issues that websites can experience. In doing so,
we'll learn the characteristics of each performance problem so that you can
recognize them in the future. Let's get started!
