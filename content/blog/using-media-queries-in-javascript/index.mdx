Using media queries is very popular in CSS, but did you know they can also be
used in JavaScript? Instead of attaching a resize event listener to `window`,
consider using the more performant `matchMedia` API.

```js
// Set a media query in JavaScript.
const mediaQuery = matchMedia('(min-width: 1000px)');
// Listen to viewport width changes involving the above media query.
mediaQuery.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  // Using `e.matches` is not prone to expensive style recalcs/layout that
  // checking properties like `window.innerWidth`` might cause.
  if (e.matches) {
    // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
  } else {
    // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
  }

}
```
