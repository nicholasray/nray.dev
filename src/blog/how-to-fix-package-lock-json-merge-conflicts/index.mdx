When working on a project with multiple team members, you may
encounter merge conflicts in the project's `package-lock.json` file
after adding dependencies.

It may be tempting to resolve these conflicts manually by reviewing
each conflict in the lock file. But it's often easier and less
error-prone to let the package manager resolve the conflicts for you.

## Example

Here's an example of how to fix merge conflicts in a
`package-lock.json` file when merging the `main` branch into another
branch:

1. Fetch the latest changes from origin:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

2. Replace package-lock.json file with the one from the `origin/main`
   branch:

```bash
git checkout origin/main -- package-lock.json
```

3. Let npm generate the correct package-lock.json file without merge
   conflicts

```bash
npm install
```
