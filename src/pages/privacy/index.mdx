# Privacy policy

- Last updated: August 6, 2022

NRAY LLC's policies are open source, licensed under
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Adapted from the
[Basecamp open-source policies](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) /
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In
this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled;
and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data:
never have, never will.

This policy applies to all products built and maintained by NRAY LLC including
nray.dev.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in
practice:

### Identity & access

When you sign up for a NRAY LLC product, we ask for identifying information such
as your name, email address. That’s so we can send you product updates and other
essential information. We may send you optional surveys from time to time to
help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your
consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates.

We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use
your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Website interactions

We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and
statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new
product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system
versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to
load, and which website referred you to us.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email nray.dev with a question or to ask for help, we keep that
correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past
correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to
surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to
record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with
your express consent.

## When we access or share your information

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. We use some third-party
subprocessors to manage newsletter subscriptions and sending customer surveys.

No NRAY LLC human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your
express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated
process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare
cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as
possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in
order to respond to legal process (see “When required under applicable law”
below).

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing
a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last
resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the
people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those
responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our
products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including
notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

**When required under applicable law.**

NRAY LLC is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

- Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests
  for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited
  circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law
  enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or
  court order requiring us to share data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only
  respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled
  by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal
  assistance treaty or agreement. It is NRAY LLC's policy to notify affected
  users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and
  except in some emergency cases.
- Preservation requests. Similarly, NRAY LLC's policy is to comply with requests
  to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications
  Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for
  civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless required by law or
  compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless
  we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required
  preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer
  data at the end of the preservation period.
- If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share
  billing-related information. If that happens, we will share only the minimum
  needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if NRAY LLC is acquired by or merges with another company — we don’t
plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any of your
personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy
policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

At NRAY LLC, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers,
regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

- **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is
  collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific
  bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
- **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal
  information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about
  the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
- **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your
  personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request,
  subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal
  information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our
  service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you
  from using NRAY LLC services because our applications may then no longer work.
  In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
- **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our
  handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory
  authority.
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of
  how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting
  out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell
  your personal data.)
- **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to
  how or why your personal information is processed.
- **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal
  information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
- **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right
  to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly
  significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
  This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any
  contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your
  explicit consent.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different
  amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower
  level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.
  However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising
  those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account
information.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please
contact us at [nray@nray.dev](mailto:nray@nray.dev).

If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to
file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via
[SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when
transmitted from our servers to your browser.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you
are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United
States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be
transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our websites or
Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this
transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

There are a few ad hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the
U.S. in connection with NRAY LLC operations, for instance, if an EU user signs
up for our newsletter or participates in one of our surveys. Such transfers are
only occasional and data is transferred under the
[Article 49(1)(b) derogation](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-49-gdpr/) under GDPR and
the UK version of GDPR.

reflect any new practices. You can view a history of the changes to our policies
