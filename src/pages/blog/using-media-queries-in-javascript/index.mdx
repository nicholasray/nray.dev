  used in JavaScript? Instead of using a scroll event listener, consider using
  the more performant `matchMedia` API."

Media queries in CSS are often used to change the styling or visibility of
elements when the website is accessed with a particular device/environment or
when the browser's viewport size or orientation changes. They are a vital part
of any responsive web design.

You may sometimes want to execute JavaScript code when a media query condition
has been met. For example, maybe you want to run code when the viewport width is
greater or equal to 1000px. The `resize` event is often used in this situation:

```js
window.addEventListener("resize", (e) => {
  if (window.innerWidth >= 1000) {
    // The viewport is greater or equal to 1000px.
  }
});
```

There are multiple problems with this approach, however:

- It can be expensive. The event listener callback will be called **each time**
  the browser's window is resized. As a result, it can fire at an extremely high
  rate and make your website feel sluggish if your callback has expensive
  operations.
- It can become complex. To mitigate performance issues and reduce the frequency
  that the code inside the event listener callback executes, a developer may use
  debouncing or throttling. In addition, if you only want the code in the
  callback to run when it **crosses** the breakpoint, you may have to introduce
  some state that tracks if the viewport has already crossed a particular
  breakpoint so that it doesn't fire multiple times.

There must be a better way to execute some JavaScript code when the viewport
crosses a particular breakpoint or meets a media query condition. Luckily,
JavaScript has your back!

## Using matchMedia() in JavaScript

The `matchMedia` API is a performant and simple solution that should be
considered when you want JavaScript code to execute when a media query status
has changed.

```js
// Set a media query in JavaScript.
const mediaQuery = matchMedia("(min-width: 1000px)");
// Listen to viewport width changes involving the media query above.
mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  // Using `e.matches` is not prone to expensive style recalcs/layout that
  // checking properties like `window.innerWidth` might cause.
  if (e.matches) {
    // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
  } else {
    // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
  }
});
```

Unlike the `resize` event handler callback, the callback passed to
`mediaQuery.addEventListener()` in the example above will only fire when a
**change** in media query status has occurred. Because of this, we don't have to
worry about using throttling or debouncing or keeping track of whether the code
has already been executed for a given viewport state.

## Using addListener to support older browsers.

There is a caveat with this approach, though. Older browsers such as versions of
Safari before version 14 implement an
[older and now deprecated API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList/addListener).
They don't support `mediaQuery.addEventListener()` and will throw an error if
used. Instead, they use `mediaQuery.addListener()` which has a slightly
different call signature.

Because of the differences in browser support, it is imperative to use
[feature detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection)
so that the widest range of browsers are supported:

```js
const mediaQuery = matchMedia("(min-width: 1000px)");

const handler = (e) => {
  // Using `e.matches` is not prone to expensive style recalcs/layout that
  // checking properties like `window.innerWidth` might cause.
  if (e.matches) {
    // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
  } else {
    // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
  }
};

// If the browser supports the `addEventListener` API, the following line will
// be truthy, so we use it. If not, it will be falsy, and we use the deprecated
// `addListener` API.
mediaQuery.addEventListener
  ? mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", handler)
  : mediaQuery.addListener(handler);
```

## Running code on page load

The `matchMedia` API also supports querying the media query status. This can be
important when setting up the page's initial state during page load, for
example:

```js
// Set a media query in JavaScript.
const mediaQuery = matchMedia("(min-width: 1000px)");
// Check media query status.
if (mediaQuery.matches) {
  // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
} else {
  // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
}
```

## Full solution

The full native JavaScript solution will often look something like the
following:

```js
// Set a media query in JavaScript.
const mediaQuery = matchMedia("(min-width: 1000px)");

// Listen to viewport width changes involving the media query above.
const handler = (e) => {
  // Using `e.matches` is not prone to expensive style recalcs/layout that
  // checking properties like `window.innerWidth` might cause.
  if (e.matches) {
    // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
  } else {
    // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
  }
};

// If the browser supports the `addEventListener` API, the following line will
// be truthy, so we use it. If not, it will be falsy, and we use the deprecated
// `addListener` API.
mediaQuery.addEventListener
  ? mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", handler)
  : mediaQuery.addListener(handler);

// Check during page load.
handler(mediaQuery);
```

## Using media queries in React

The `matchMedia` API can also be a useful hook in React. Here it is with
typescript:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

/**
 * @param query The media query to match against.
 */
function useMediaQuery(query: string) {
  // Support isomorphic rendering by checking if `window` (clientside) exists.
  // If not, then this code is probably being executed on the backend.
  const mediaQuery = typeof window !== "undefined" ? matchMedia(query) : false;
  const [matches, setMatches] = useState(mediaQuery && mediaQuery.matches);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!mediaQuery) {
      return;
    }

    const handler = (e: MediaQueryListEvent) => {
      /**
       * Using `e.matches` is more performant than checking properties like
       * `window.innerWidth` which are prone to causing expensive style
       * recalcs/layout operations.
       *
       * @see https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a
       */
      if (e.matches) {
        // The viewport is >= 1000px wide.
        setMatches(true);
      } else {
        // The viewport is < 1000px wide.
        setMatches(false);
      }
    };

    // If the browser supports the `addEventListener` API, the following line will
    // be truthy so we use it. If not, it will be falsy and we use the deprecated
    // `addListener` API.
    mediaQuery.addEventListener
      ? mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", handler)
      : mediaQuery.addListener(handler);

    // Clean up event listener after this effect is no longer needed.
    return () =>
      mediaQuery.removeEventListener
        ? mediaQuery.removeEventListener("change", handler)
        : mediaQuery.removeListener(handler);
    // Don't change when the mediaQuery reference changes as we only use that on
    // the first render.
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [query]);

  return matches;
}

export default useMediaQuery;
```

Using the hook is then as simple as passing in the media query:

```js
function Component() {
  const matches = useMatchMedia("(min-width: 1000px)");

  return (
    <div>
      {matches && ">= 1000px"}
      {!matches && "< 1000px"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

JavaScript's `matchMedia` API is a simple and performant way of detecting when a
media query status change has occurred. Use it without the performance penalty
of alternative solutions like listening to the `resize` event.
