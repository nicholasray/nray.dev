Have you ever visited a website in a dark room that smothers the screen in
bright white pixels?

_Ouch_.

Apart from being
[easier on the eyes](https://medium.com/dev-channel/let-there-be-darkness-maybe-9facd9c3023d),
a website that offers a dark mode option may:

- [increase reading rates for people with cataract and other visual disorders](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/)
- [reduce power use by 63% on AMOLED screens](https://www.techspot.com/news/77340-dark-mode-saves-lot-phone-battery-life-google.html)
- [promote better sleep](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/blue-light)
  by emitting less blue light, although that's
  [debatable](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/642949)
- look more aesthetically pleasing to users

In this article, you'll learn how to implement a dark mode theme using
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), one of the most popular CSS
frameworks. Nevertheless, many of the concepts presented in this article apply
to any dark mode implementation.

## Using the dark mode variant class in Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS allows you to easily style elements using a set of utility class
names. Adding dark mode support is no different. Simply prefix any supported
class name with `dark:`, and that style will apply when the user has enabled
their operating system's dark mode setting.

The following example defaults to a white background with dark gray text if the
user hasn't enabled dark mode on their operating system. If they have, the box
will have a dark gray background with white text:

<BlogIframe
  class="h-40 w-72"
  src="/blog/how-to-build-tailwind-css-dark-mode/demos/dark-variant"
/>

```html /dark:bg-gray-900/
<div
  class="h-full rounded-lg bg-white p-4 text-gray-900 shadow-lg dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-white"
>
  <span class="dark:hidden">Light mode</span>
  <span class="hidden dark:block">Dark mode</span>
</div>
```

Try toggling your operating system's dark mode setting to activate or inactivate
the dark mode styles.

If you inspect the styles of elements that have the `dark` variant prefix,
you'll see that it adds a wrapping `prefers-color-scheme` media query to the
underlying style so that it only becomes active when the user has requested the
relevant theme on their system:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .dark\:bg-gray-700 {
    --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
    background-color: rgb(55 65 81 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
  }
}
```

In the example above, the gray background color will only apply when the user
has chosen the dark theme on their device.

## Picking a good default

It's tempting to think that users who prefer dark mode will flock to any toggle
button you add to the page. But most users
[won't bother customizing their experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization-of-uis-and-products)
â€” they just want to get things done. Therefore, it's essential to have a good
default theme.

Luckily the user's operating system can provide it. The latest versions of
Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android operating systems all feature a dark mode
setting that users can choose.
