Have you ever been frustrated from interacting with a website that was slow to
respond to your clicks or had jerky scrolling? Performance flaws like these can
lead to the following:

- [Rage clicking](https://speakerdeck.com/bluesmoon/ux-and-performance-metrics-that-matter-a062d37f-e6c7-4b8a-8399-472ec76bb75e?slide=13)
- [Increased bounce rates and decreased conversion rates](https://edgemesh.com/blog/time-to-interactive-and-conversion-rate)
- [Lower search engine ranking](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/11/bringing-page-experience-to-desktop)

For more than three years, Wikipedia's mobile site suffered from a piece of
JavaScript that could take over
[600ms to execute](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241139) during page load
on low-end devices, effectively blocking user interactions.

In this article, we'll walk through a couple of easy steps I took to reduce the
execution time of this task by about 50%.

## Total Blocking Time: Why long tasks matter

600ms of synchronous JavaScript execution may not sound like a long time, but
imagine if a user tried to click a button during page load when the 600ms of
JavaScript began executing. Because only one task can be processed on the
browser's
[main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread) at
any given time, the user would need to wait for the following steps to finish
before they see a visual update:

1. The 600ms JavaScript task executes
2. The relevant click handler task executes
3. The browser performs the necessary rendering steps to update the page
   visually

import mainThreadClick from "./assets/main-thread-click.png";

<Image

  src={mainThreadClick}
  alt="Main thread timeline showing a click occurring at the beginning of a long task. The click callback executes after completing the long task, followed by a browser paint. A visual update only appears after the paint."
  caption="A long task can delay the execution of a click handler that produces a visual update."
/>

Each step takes time, and the user can perceive any interaction that takes
longer than [100ms](https://web.dev/rail/#response-process-events-in-under-50ms)
as **slow**. Because of this, Google considers any task that takes
[more than 50ms](https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/#what-is-the-main-thread) a
"long task" that can affect the page's responsiveness to user input. They even
developed a metric for this called "Total Blocking Time" (TBT).

import mainThreadTasks from "./assets/main-thread-tasks.png";

<Image
  background
  src={mainThreadTasks}
  alt="A timeline from first contentful paint to time to interactive showing a 80ms task, a 30ms task, and a 100ms task on the main thread."
  caption="There are two long tasks (> 50ms) — the 80ms task and the 100ms task."
/>

## What is Total Blocking Time?

TBT measures the sum of the blocking portion of all long tasks on the browser's
main thread between [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/fcp/) (FCP) and
[Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/tti/) (TTI). The "blocking portion" is the
time after 50ms of each long task.

Let's try calculating the TBT in the example below:

import mainThreadTasksTbt from "./assets/main-thread-tasks-tbt.png";

<Image background src={mainThreadTasksTbt} alt="Main thread tasks" />

1. The 80ms task is **30ms** longer than 50ms so contributes **30ms** to TBT.
2. The 30ms task doesn't contribute to TBT since it is less than 50ms and NOT a
   long task.
3. The 100ms task is **50ms** longer than 50ms so contributes **50ms** to TBT.

Since TBT is the sum of the time exceeding 50ms of each long task, the TBT for
this example is 30ms + 50ms = **80ms**.

When tested on average mobile hardware, Google
[recommends](https://web.dev/tbt/#what-is-a-good-tbt-score) sites have a TBT of
less than **200 milliseconds**. But Wikipedia's longest task could take **600
milliseconds** — 3x the recommended limit.

How do we improve TBT?

## How to reduce Total Blocking Time

To decrease TBT, we need to either:

- Do less work on the main thread between First Contentful Paint and Time to
  Interactive
- Do the same amount of work, but break up long tasks into smaller tasks that
  don't exceed 50ms

This article focuses on making gains from the first bullet point.

## Step 1: Remove unnecessary JavaScript

While many things run on the main thread, including HTML parsing, paints, and
garbage collection, long JavaScript execution is frequently the culprit of TBT
problems. After all,
[JavaScript is the fastest way to slow down a site](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/).

import profileBeginning from "./assets/profile-beginning.png";

<Image
  background
  src={profileBeginning}
  alt="Chrome performance profile showing that a `_enable` method took 475ms to execute."
/>

When I profiled Wikipedia's mobile site, I found that an `_enable` method was
responsible for most of the execution time. This method initialized the mobile
site's section expansion and collapsing behavior. The profile also showed that,
within the `_enable` method, a call to jQuery's `.on("click")` method was slow.

```js {6-15}
function _enable( $container, prefix, page, isClosed ) {
  ...
  // Restricted to links created by editors and thus outside our control
  // T166544 - don't do this for reference links - they will be handled elsewhere
  var $link = $container.find("a:not(.reference a)");
  $link.on("click", function () {
    // the link might be an internal link with a hash.
    // if it is check if we need to reveal any sections.
    if (
      $link.attr("href") !== undefined &&
      $link.attr("href").indexOf("#") > -1
    ) {
      checkHash();
    }
  });
  util.getWindow().on("hashchange", function () {
    checkHash();
  });
}
```

The `.on("click")` call attached a click event listener to nearly every link in
the content so that the corresponding section would open if the clicked link
contained a hash fragment. For short articles with few links, the performance
impact was negligible. But long articles like
"[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)" included over
4,000 links, leading to over 200ms of execution time on low-end devices.

Worse yet, this behavior was **unnecessary**. The downstream code that listened
to the `hashchange` event already called the same method that the click event
listener called. Unless the window's location already pointed at the link's
destination, clicking a link called the `checkHash` method twice — once for the
link click event handler and once more for the `hashchange` handler.

import profileRemoval from "./assets/profile-removing-unnecessary-code.png";

<Image
  background
  src={profileRemoval}
  alt="Chrome performance profile showing that an `on` method took 264ms to execute. All of this code was removed."
/>

Therefore, in this case, the best approach was to simply
[remove this block of JavaScript](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/MobileFrontend/+/908333/6/src/mobile.startup/Toggler.js#22)
and free up nearly 200ms from the main thread with virtually the same
functionality.

When profiling, always check where the most time is spent. Then, see if there is
code you can either optimize or, better yet, remove.

**Remember, the fastest way to speed up a site is to _remove_ JavaScript.**

## Step 2: Optimize existing JavaScript

import profileMediaViewer from "./assets/profile-media-viewer.png";

<Image
  background
  src={profileMediaViewer}
  alt="Chrome performance profile showing that an `initMediaViewer` method took 114ms to execute."
/>

An additional performance review revealed that an `initMediaViewer` method took
~100ms to execute . This method was responsible for attaching a click event
listener to **each** thumbnail in the content so that a click to a thumbnail
would open a media viewer:

```js
/**
 * Event handler for clicking on an image thumbnail
 *
 * @param {jQuery.Event} ev
 * @ignore
 */
function onClickImage(ev) {
  ev.preventDefault();
  routeThumbnail($(this).data("thumb"));
}

/**
 * Add routes to images and handle clicks
 *
 * @method
 * @ignore
 * @param {jQuery.Object} [$container] Optional container to search within
 */
function initMediaViewer($container) {
  currentPageHTMLParser.getThumbnails($container).forEach(function (thumb) {
    thumb.$el.off().data("thumb", thumb).on("click", onClickImage);
  });
}
```

Similar to the link example in step 1, attaching an event listener to each
thumbnail on the page doesn't scale well. Editors of Wikipedia articles can (and
do) make articles with
[thousands of images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B8_polytope). When this
block of code ran, it could take well over 100 milliseconds to execute for pages
with a lot of images and increase the TBT of the page. What is an alternative
approach?

Use **event delegation**.

Event delegation is a powerful technique that enables us to attach a single
event listener to an element that is the common ancestor of many elements. Using
event delegation is often more efficient when dealing with user-generated
content that could add any number of elements. It takes advantage of
[event bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling)
and works like this:

1. Attach an event listener to a container element.
2. Using the `event` param in the event handler, check the `event.target`
   property to see the source of the event. Optionally use the
   `event.target.closest(selector)`
   [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) to
   check for an ancestor element.
3. If the source of the event is an element or the child of an element we're
   interested in, handle it.

The
[updated code](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/skins/MinervaNeue/+/908675/10/resources/skins.minerva.scripts/initMobile.js#66)
looked like the following:

```js
/**
 * Event handler for clicking on an image thumbnail
 *
 * @param {MouseEvent} ev
 * @ignore
 */
function onClickImage(ev) {
  var el = ev.target.closest(PageHTMLParser.THUMB_SELECTOR);
  if (!el) {
    return;
  }

  var thumb = currentPageHTMLParser.getThumbnail($(el));
  if (!thumb) {
    return;
  }

  ev.preventDefault();
  routeThumbnail(thumb);
}

/**
 * Add routes to images and handle clicks
 *
 * @method
 * @ignore
 * @param {HTMLElement} container Container to search within
 */
function initMediaViewer(container) {
  container.addEventListener("click", onClickImage);
}
```

In this case:

1. I revised the `initMediaViewer` method to attach one click event listener to
   a single container element that contained all the images.
2. In the `onClickImage` method, I used the `ev.target.closest(selector)` API to
   check if the click originated from a thumbnail or a child of a thumbnail
   element. If it didn't, the code returns early since we only care about clicks
   to thumbnails. If it did, the code handles the event.

But what were the results of this work?

## Conclusion

We released the optimizations outlined in steps 1 and 2 to production in two
deploys — step 1 followed by step 2.

According to Wikipedia's
[synthetic performance test](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic#synthetic_monitoring)
data, the first deployment resulted in a reduction of TBT by approximately
200ms, while the second deployment improved TBT by around 80ms when testing on a
real Moto G (5) phone. Overall, these two steps reduced TBT by nearly **300ms**
on devices like the Moto G (5) phone visiting long articles.

While there is still room for further improvement, with the task still exceeding
the recommended limit on low-end devices, the progress made so far is
significant. To achieve even greater reductions in TBT, it may be necessary to
[break up the task into smaller tasks](https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/#task-management-strategies).

What this experience demonstrates is that significant performance improvements
can be achieved through small, targeted optimizations. By removing or optimizing
specific sections of code, even seemingly minor changes can have a substantial
impact on a website's overall performance. It serves as a reminder that
delivering a more responsive browsing experience that can work on any device
doesn't always require complex and extensive changes to the codebase. Sometimes,
it's the smaller wins that make the biggest difference.
