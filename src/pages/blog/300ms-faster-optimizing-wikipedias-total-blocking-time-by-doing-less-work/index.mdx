Have you ever visited a website that took a long time to respond to your clicks
or suffered from janky scrolling when using your mobile device? Performance
flaws like these can lead to:

- [Rage clicking](https://speakerdeck.com/bluesmoon/ux-and-performance-metrics-that-matter-a062d37f-e6c7-4b8a-8399-472ec76bb75e?slide=13)
- [Increased bounce rates and decreased conversion rates](https://edgemesh.com/blog/time-to-interactive-and-conversion-rate)

For more than three years, Wikipedia's mobile site had a piece of JavaScript
that could take around
[700ms to execute](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241139) during page load
on low-end devices visiting longish articles like the
["Barack Obama"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) article.

In this article, we'll walk through a couple easy steps I took to improve the
responsiveness of Wikipedia's mobile site.

# What's the big deal?

700ms may not sound like a large amount of time, but imagine if a user tried to
click on something when this JavaScript was beginning to execute. Because
JavaScript is single-threaded, the user would need to wait at least this amount
of time before the browser could respond to that interaction with a visual
update. And users _can_ perceive this slowdown since it is longer than the
[recommended 100ms response time for user interactions](https://web.dev/rail/#response-process-events-in-under-50ms).

In fact, Google considers anything on the browser's
[main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread)
that takes
[longer than 50ms](https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/#what-is-the-main-thread)
to be a "long task" that can affect responsiveness. They even have a metric for
this called "Total Blocking Time" which measures

## Step 1: Do less work
