# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

Most of the web is slow and janky. I help people achieve faster websites,
happier users, and better business results.

Recently, I helped develop
[Wikipedia's 2023 redesign](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/)
as a senior software engineer, optimizing its features for performance and user
experience.

I use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make websites fast and delightful on
any device.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.
