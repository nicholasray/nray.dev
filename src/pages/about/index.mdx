# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I help people achieve faster websites, happier users, and better business
results.

Recently, I helped develop
[Wikipedia's 2023 redesign](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/),
optimizing its features for performance and user experience as a senior software
engineer.

I use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make websites fast and delightful on
any device.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

Thank you for reading my blog!
