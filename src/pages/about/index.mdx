# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit
organization that operates Wikipedia, where I helped develop
[Wikipedia's 2023 redesign](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/).

I enjoy using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS to make websites performant,
accessible, and impactful.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

Thank you for reading my blog!
