# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm currently
working at Wikipedia and have 8+ years of web development experience. I
specialize in front-end development and enjoy using JavaScript, TypeScript,
HTML, CSS, and React to make websites and apps focused on performance,
accessibility, and a delightful user experience.

Feel free to drop me an email if you have any questions or just want to chat.
From time to time, I am also available for contract work. You can reach me at:
