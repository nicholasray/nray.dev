# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience. I help people achieve
faster websites, happier users, and better business results.

Recently, I helped develop
[Wikipedia's 2023 redesign](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/),
optimizing its performance and user experience for over 10 billion page views
each month. Using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, I strive to develop
solutions that work well on any network connection and device.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.
