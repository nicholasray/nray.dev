# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit
organization that operates Wikipedia, where I specialize in front-end
development of the desktop and mobile sites, including helping
[redesign the desktop site](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/01/18/wikipedia-gets-a-fresh-new-look-first-desktop-update-in-a-decade-puts-usability-at-the-forefront/).

I enjoy using technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React
to make websites performant, accessible, secure, and delightful.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

Thank you for reading my blog!
