# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah with over 8 years
of web development experience.

I'm currently working at Wikipedia and specialize in front-end development. I
enjoy using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React to make websites and
apps focused on performance, accessibility, and a delightful user experience.

From time to time, I am available for contract work. Let's chat at:
