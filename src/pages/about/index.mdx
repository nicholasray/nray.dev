# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer with over eight years of web development
experience.

I work at Wikipedia, specializing in front-end development of the desktop and
mobile sites that serve free knowledge to over
[20 billion page views](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects) each month.
Most recently, I have been improving the
[UI of the desktop skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements).

I enjoy using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React to make websites
performant, accessible, secure, and delightful.

In my free time, I like to simplify complex web development and computer science
topics through writings shared on this site. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah,
where I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

From time to time, I am available for contract work. Let's chat!
