# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a senior software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah, with over eight
years of web development experience.

I'm currently working at Wikipedia, where I specialize in front-end development
of the desktop and mobile sites, which serve free knowledge to over
[20 billion page views](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects) each month.
Most recently, I have been working to improve the
[UI of the desktop skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements).

I enjoy using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React to make websites
performant, accessible, secure, and delightful.

I like to simplify complex web development and computer science topics in my
free time through the writings I share on this site. I also enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

From time to time, I am available for contract work. Let's chat at:
