# Hi, I'm Nicholas Ray

I'm a software engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization
that operates Wikipedia, where I specialize in front-end development of the
desktop and mobile sites. Most recently, I have been working on improving the
[UI of the desktop skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements).

I enjoy using technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React
to make websites performant, accessible, secure, and delightful.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, with my two rambunctious dogs and beautiful
wife. In my free time, I enjoy
[backpacking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(hiking)>) and
[packrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packraft), especially in southern
Utah.

Thank you for reading my blog!
