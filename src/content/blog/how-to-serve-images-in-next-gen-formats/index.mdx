Running a Lighthouse or [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
audit on your website may warn you to "**Serve images in next-gen
formats.**" The audit flags images that could have been at least 8 KB
smaller with a newer format like **WebP** or **AVIF**.

import Image from "@components/BlogImage.astro";

import psi from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-next-gen-image-formats.webp";

So how do you fix it? **Generally**, you need to convert your **JPEG** and
**PNG** images to **WebP** or **AVIF**, as they typically result in faster
load times while maintaining excellent quality.

Using older formats like **JPEG**, **PNG**, or **GIF** for all your images
will likely slow down your site. In this article, I'll explain your options
for serving the newer formats.

## Why does this matter?

The JPEG and PNG formats were released over **25 years ago**. Since then,
people developed newer formats with better compression, resulting in
smaller file sizes, faster download times, and less bandwidth consumption.

## What new formats have the best browser support?

**WebP** and **AVIF** currently have the best browser support:

| Format    | Initial Release | Browser support (in Aug 2023) |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GIF       | 1987            | ~100%                         |
| JPEG      | 1992            | ~100%                         |
| PNG       | 1996            | ~100%                         |
| JPEG 2000 | 2000            | 20.14%                        |
| **WebP**  | **2010**        | **96.76%**                    |
| HEIC      | 2015            | 0.03%                         |
| **AVIF**  | **2019**        | **85%**                       |
| JPEG XL   | 2021            | 0.03%                         |

There was a time when WebP had much lower browser compatibility. But now,
**all** modern browsers support WebP, including the latest versions of
Safari. AVIF has also seen steadily increasing support.

Check caniuse for the latest [WebP](https://caniuse.com/avif) and
[AVIF](https://caniuse.com/avif) browser compatibility.

## How do next-gen formats improve performance?

Smaller image file sizes result in faster download times since the browser
has fewer bytes to download. But how much smaller are WebP and AVIF
compared to PNG and JPEG? It depends on the image. Several studies show
huge improvements, though:

- WebP file sizes were
  [23% smaller than PNG](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study)
  with the same visual quality in a study from Google
- WebP file sizes were
  [25%-34% smaller than JPEG](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study)
  with the same visual quality in another study from Google
- AVIF
  [showed much better compression efficiency than JPEG](https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4)
  in a study from Netflix.
- AVIF had
  [significantly better compression](https://storage.googleapis.com/avif-comparison/index.htm)
  compared to WebP and JPEG in a study from Google

The proper image format can significantly improve your website's load time,
especially when using other techniques like
[lazy loading images](/blog/how-to-defer-offscreen-images/).
You can use
[Cloudinary's image analysis tool](https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com/) on
your website to see the file size differences you might get from picking
the correct format and compression.

Since images are commonly the largest element above the fold, images that
load fast can also improve your
[**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**](https://web.dev/lcp/) time â€” a
[Core Web Vital](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals)
that affects your website's search engine ranking on Google.

## How do I serve WebP or AVIF?

Ultimately, your strategy to serve WebP or AVIF depends on your desired
optimization level, browser compatibility requirements, and technical
stack.

### Option 1: Only serve WebP

Given that WebP now has good [browser support](https://caniuse.com/webp),
the simplest option is to always save or convert your
[raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) images to WebP
format using one of the following methods:

- Manually save and compress each image to WebP with a tool like
  [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) that lets you see the impact on quality
  and file size.
- Bulk convert using a tool like [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)
  or [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp).

Once converted, you can use WebP with the standard image element:

```html
<img src="/cat.webp" width="200" height="200" alt="A sitting cat" />
```

But there are a couple of downsides to this approach:

- By only using WebP, you are likely losing out on (much) smaller file
  sizes that you might get from the less supported AVIF format.
- Users with browsers that don't support WebP won't see **any image** that
  uses the WebP format.

import noWebPSupport from "./_assets/no-webp-support-experience.webp";

<Image
  src={noWebPSupport}
  alt="Screenshot of nray.dev page using an emulated Chrome setting that turns off WebP support. As a result, the browser shows whitespace instead of images. "
  caption="If you exclusively use WebP images, browsers that don't support it won't show any image."
/>

So how can you solve both of these issues?

### Option 2: Serve different formats with HTML

You can save to multiple image formats using the same tools mentioned
above. For the most optimized image supporting the most extensive set of
browsers, save to **AVIF**, **WebP**, and **JPEG** (or **PNG**) formats.

Then, let the browser decide which format to load using HTML like the
following:

```html
<picture>
  <!-- Load the AVIF, if supported  -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="/cat.avif" />
  <!-- Otherwise, load the WebP, if supported -->
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/cat.webp" />
  <!-- If AVIF and WebP aren't supported, load the JPEG-->
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/cat.jpg" />
  <!-- If AVIF, WebP, and the picture element aren't supported, load
  the JPEG using the img element-->
  <img
    width="200"
    height="200"
    alt="A sitting cat."
    type="image/jpg"
    srcset="/cat.jpg"
  />
</picture>
```

The order of the `<source>` and `<img>` elements is essential as the
browser will load the first supported format starting from the top. For
example:

- If the browser supports AVIF, it will load the AVIF image using the first
  `<source>` element
- If the browser doesn't support AVIF but supports WebP, it will load the
  WebP image using the second `<source>` element
- If the browser doesn't support AVIF or WebP, it will load the JPEG via
  the third `<source>` element.
- If the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element
  ([IE11](https://caniuse.com/picture)), it will use the JPEG from the
  `<img>` element.

In practice, offering multiple formats can quickly become complex when you
want
[responsive images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#responsive-images-with-srcset)
as well. The relatively simple markup from above turns into something like
this:

```html
<!-- Supporting different image formats is easy and fun ðŸ˜­ -->
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="
      /img/cat-1920w.avif 1920w,
      /img/cat-1280w.avif 1280w,
      /img/cat-640w.avif   640w,
      /img/cat-320w.avif   320w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 750px"
    type="image/avif"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      /cat-1920w.webp 1920w,
      /cat-1280w.webp 1280w,
      /cat-640w.webp   640w,
      /cat-320w.webp   320w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 750px"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      /img/cat-1920w.jpg 1920w,
      /img/cat-1280w.jpg 1280w,
      /img/cat-640w.jpg   640w,
      /img/cat-320w.jpg   320w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 750px"
    type="image/jpeg"
  />
  <img width="200" height="200" alt="A sitting cat." src="/cat.jpg" />
</picture>
```

The increased HTML size should compress well if your server supports HTTP
compression like [GZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) or
[Brotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli). But saving or converting to
all of these different sizes and formats can be painful.

What can you do instead?

### Option 3: Serve different formats with content negotiation

The third option is to use JPEG or PNG and have logic on the server to do
the heavy lifting. How does this work? When requesting an image, the
browser tells the server what formats it supports via the `Accept` header.

import acceptHeader from "./_assets/accept-header.webp";

<Image
  src={acceptHeader}
  alt="Screenshot of an image request to Unsplash with the `Accept` HTTP header showing support for AVIF, WebP, and PNG"
  caption="The browser tells the server what formats it supports with each image request."
/>

The server uses this header to send back the most optimized and compatible
image, even if it is in a different format than the one requested. This
process is called
[**content negotiation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation),
but what this means is that you can save a high-quality image as a JPEG or
PNG and just use that in your HTML. Even if you want responsive images, the
markup becomes relatively simple:

```html
<img
  src="/cat.jpg"
  width="200"
  height="200"
  alt="A sitting cat."
  srcset="
    /img/cat-1920w.jpg 1920w,
    /img/cat-1280w.jpg 1280w,
    /img/cat-640w.jpg   640w,
    /img/cat-320w.jpg   320w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 750px"
/>
```

**With content negotiation, adding extra HTML to support different formats
is unnecessary**. The server will choose the best compression and format,
typically a WebP or AVIF, and send _that_ back to the user.

How do you use content negotiation?

## How to use content negotiation

First, your technical stack may already have a service or plugin with
content negotiation that you can use. For example, the NextJS framework
ships with an
[image optimization API](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/improve/images) that
uses content negotiation to choose the best format the browser supports.

Although it's not free, you may already be on a CDN like
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/cloudflare-images/),
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/products/image-optimization), or
[Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/products/image-and-video-manager) that
offers an image service with content negotiation.

Finally, dedicated image services like
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [imgix](https://imgix.com/) are
also popular options that use content negotiation.

Ideally, the image's URL should point to the same domain that your website
uses instead of something like `https://res.cloudinary.com/.../cat.jpg`. If
it's different, the browser must spend extra time setting up another
connection, which can negate the benefits of image optimization.
One option to get around this is to
[proxy image requests](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-11-17-netlify-proxy-requests/)
to another domain from your domain.

## What about SVGs?

Despite being over 20 years old, SVGs still have a place on the web for
images composed of simple lines, points, polygons, and text. **Icons**,
**logos**, and **simple illustrations** are often good use cases for the
SVG format.

Why is this format still relevant? Unlike raster images like AVIF, WebP,
PNG, JPEG, which encodes pixels in a rectangular grid, the SVG format uses
points, lines, curves, and polygons to make an image that is sharp at any
resolution and zoom level. As a result, the HTML for external SVGs is
simple without needing to add any responsive attributes like `srcset` and
`sizes`:

```html
<img src="/cat-logo.svg" width="200" height="200" alt="A sitting cat." />
```

If you use SVG images, be sure to do the following to make SVGs as small as
possible:

- Optimize SVGs with a tool like [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
- Ensure your website's server has HTTP compression like GZIP or Brotli
  enabled for SVGs

import svgBr from "./_assets/svg-br-compression.webp";

<Image
  src={svgBr}
  alt="Screenshot of an SVG image request with Chrome DevTools showing a `Content-Encoding` response header with Brotli compression"
  caption="Use HTTP compression like GZIP or Brotli to reduce the transfer size of SVGs"
/>

## Serving images in WordPress

- [WordPress 5.8+](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/07/wordpress-5-8-adds-webp-support/)
  can upload and use WebP images
- A
  [proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/28/enabling-webp-by-default/)
  to automatically convert JPEGs to WebP and make WebP the default format
  was [controversial](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443). The
  community raised concerns about  
  [disk space](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/289) and
  [compatibility](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/290).
  Although both tickets associated with these issues are now resolved, it's
  [unclear](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/22) when or if
  this will land in the core WordPress platform. For now, using a
  [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/convert+avif/) that does
  automatic conversion or content negotiation is an option.

## Conclusion

Newer image formats can drastically reduce image sizes and improve load
times. Each format has its
[strengths and weaknesses](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary-marketing/image/upload/w_700,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/Web_Assets/blog/Battle-of-the-Codecs_fnl.png),
but in general:

- Prefer `<video>` elements over **animated GIFs**. Most of the time, the
  compressed video will be significantly smaller.
- Prefer SVG for images composed of relatively simple lines, points,
  polygons, and text. **Icons**, **logos**, and **simple illustrations**
  are usually good use cases for the SVG format.
- Prefer **WebP** and **AVIF** over **JPEG** and **PNG** for photos and
  screenshots.

Finally, how you serve the newer formats depends on your desired
optimization level, technical stack, and browser compatibility
requirements. Most people will likely find using an image service with
content negotiation the best balance of performance and ease.
