**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** will become the next **Core Web Vital** on
**March 2024**, replacing **First Input Delay (FID)** as the metric that
measures how quickly a page responds to user interactions.

Is your website fast enough?

At the time of this writing, things aren't looking good for about **35% of
mobile websites**, which are projected to **fail** Google's new web performance
metric.

**90% of a user's time** on a webpage happens after it loads. Users expect that
when they interact with a page by clicking a button, tapping a menu item, or
pressing a key, visual feedback happens — **and occurs quickly**. INP captures
this interaction latency and flags interactions that are slow enough to cause a
**negative user experience**.
[Rage clicking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Euu4FBL75z0I8UtKf3dTzrLYu6wxfeWnrmXUCn9AQIY/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-t6sEnmSbzYTO_fcrR8n9Jg)
is one side effect of interactions that take too long.

This article describes INP and how you can optimize it for your website to
ensure your users have snappy interactions.

## What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

INP is a metric that evaluates how quickly a page visually responds to certain
user interactions.

As a Core Web Vital, Google will use INP as one of the signals that influence
your website's search ranking. The upcoming change is expected to provide a more
accurate assessment of a user's experience on a page compared to FID. And the
numbers back this up — as of May 2023,
[99.9% of desktop sites and 93.2% of mobile sites passed FID](https://httparchive.org/reports/chrome-ux-report#cruxFastFid)
with flying colors, but this was mostly because it only measured a _portion_ of
the user's _first interaction_ on a page.

## How is INP Measured?

Throughout the lifespan of a user's visit to a page, each click, tap, and key
press is timed from its beginning to the moment a **visual update** occurs. This
elapsed time represents the **interaction's latency**. When the user leaves the
page, the INP score is calculated based on one of the recorded interaction
latencies.

Notably, the visual update doesn't _need_ to be the final desired visual state.
INP is only concerned with the time it takes to present the **next frame**
following an interaction. The frame _can_ be an **intermediate state** like a
spinner. As long as the interaction results in timely visual feedback that shows
the user _something_ has happened, you can get good INP scores. Just make sure
you use the
[best progress indicator for the situation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/).

import inpSpinner from "./_assets/inp-progress-indicator.png";

  alt="Spinner showing after a user interaction"
/>

Intuitively, the page's longest interaction latency is often used as the INP.
The exception is when a user performs over 50 interactions. In this case, the
highest interaction for every 50 interactions is ignored, hopefully reducing
extreme outliers. This might happen with single-page applications (SPAs), for
example.

As with other Core Web Vitals, the **75th percentile** of all the page views is
then reported, further reducing noise.

## What's a good INP score?

At the **75th percentile** for any given page and segmented across desktop and
mobile devices:

- INP \<= **200 milliseconds** indicates a page has **good responsiveness**
- INP \<= **500 milliseconds** indicates a page **needs improvement**
- INP \> **500 milliseconds** indicates a page has **poor responsiveness**

import inpScores from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-scores.png";

<Image background src={inpScores} alt="Interaction to Next Paint Scores" />

## What interactions does INP measure?

INP measures the following interactions:

- Mouse clicks
- Taps on touchscreens
- Key presses (physical and onscreen)

It does NOT measure:

- Hovering
- Scrolling

## What can happen during an interaction?

INP contains **three phases**:

1. **Input delay**: Begins when a user clicks, taps, or presses a key and ends
   when the JavaScript event callbacks start executing
2. **Processing time**: The total execution time of the event callbacks
3. **Presentation delay**: Begins when the event callbacks complete and ends
   when a visual update occurs

import inpComponents from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-components.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpComponents}
  alt="Interaction to Next Paint Components"
/>

Each of these phases can add time to the interaction's latency. Part of the
reason why First Input Delay rarely failed was because it only measured the
**input delay** portion of the user's first interaction. Because INP measures
all the way to the first frame a user can see, it is much better indicator of a
user's experience.

## How to measure INP

Since INP requires interactions with the page, the best way to measure it is
with real users through Real User Monitoring (RUM). Usually, this involes adding
a small piece of JavaScript to your website that tracks the responsiveness of
each interaction on a page (PageSpeed Insights is a notable exception).

You can use one of the following tools:

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [`web-vitals` JavaScript Library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals)
- [Commerical RUM tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=core+web+vitals+real+user+tools)

### PageSpeed Insights (PSI)

To get a rough idea of the interaction latency your users are experiencing, you
may be able to use data from the
[Chrome UX Report (CrUX)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/). This is a
convenient option because it doesn't require adding any tracking script to your
website. Instead, Chrome collects this data from
[eligible users](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/#user-eligibility)
automatically.

Google's [PageSpeed Insights (PSI)](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool is one tool
that makes this data easily accessible. Simply enter a URL and click the
**Analyze** button. Then, look at the "Discover what your real users are
experiencing" section.

import inpPsi from "./_assets/inp-page-speed-insights.png";

<Image background src={inpPsi} alt="Interaction to Next Paint PSI" />

When using this PageSpeeds Insights, you should be aware of the following:

- The displayed data is aggregated for the
  [most recent 28 days of data](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report/#pagespeed-insights)
- There may not be
  [sufficient data](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about#crux)
  for the page or website you're testing. If there isn't sufficient data for the
  page you've entered, PSI will try to use data from all pages of the website —
  the origin — instead. If the origin doesn't have enough data, no data will be
  shown.

### `web-vitals` JavaScript Library

Google released an open source JavaScript library that lets you measure core web
vitals (including INP) from real users. To use it, you'll need to install it
from npm:

```bash
npm install web-vitals
```

Then, import the `attribution` build into your project so that you can get more
details about the interaction:

```js
import { onINP } from "web-vitals/attribution";

onINP(console.log);
```

The above example produces the following output:

import inpWebVitalsResponse from "./_assets/inp-web-vitals-js-example-response.png";

<Image src={inpWebVitalsResponse} alt="Web Vitals Response Example " />

Importing the `web-vitals/attribution` adds an `attribution` key to the object
which you can use to derive the `input delay`, `processing time` and
`presentation delay`:

- `startTime`: Time in milliseconds at which the interaction occurred.
- `processingStart`: Time at which event callbacks started executing. The input
  delay can be derived from `processingStart - startTime`.
- `processingEnd`: Time at which event callbacks finished executing. The
  `processing time` duration can be derived from
  `processingEnd - processingStart`.
- `duration`: Total duration of interaction. The `presentation delay` can be
  derived from `startTime + duration - processingEnd`.

## What causes poor responsiveness?

Slow interactions are primarily caused by long tasks on the browser's main
thread. These tasks refer to discrete units of work carried out by the browser,
including:

- HTML parsing
- Rendering (e.g. recalculating styles, layout)
- Painting
- JavaScript execution

In short, if you eliminate long tasks on the main thread, your INP scores will
be good.

- Always try to do the least amount of work on the main thread
- Split up long tasks into smaller tasks

JavaScript and rendering are the two biggest contributors of large tasks.

## How to Optimize Interaction to Next Paint

A slow INP can be caused by many reasons, but let's go over some of the most
popular ones.

## Optimizing Input delay

### Watch out for page load and rehydration

### Do as little work as possible

### Yield to main thread

### Watch out for recurring long tasks

### Move third party code to web workers

### Task prioritization

### Be careful with `<script defer>`

### Reduce recurring timers

## Optimizing Processing time

### Use debouncing or throttling

E.g. typing into input box

### Eliminate Layout Thrashing

### Show progress

## Optimizing presentation delay
