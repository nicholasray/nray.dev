**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** will become the next **Core Web Vital** on
**March 2024**, replacing **First Input Delay (FID)** as the metric that
measures how quickly a page responds to user interactions.

Is your website fast enough?

At the time of this writing, things aren't looking good for about **35% of
mobile websites**, which are projected to **fail** Google's new web performance
metric.

**90% of a user's time** on a webpage happens after it loads. Users expect that
when they interact with a page by clicking a button, tapping a menu item, or
pressing a key, visual feedback happens — **and occurs quickly**. INP captures
this interaction latency and flags those that are slow enough to cause a
**negative user experience**.

is one side effect of interactions that take too long.

This article describes INP and how you can optimize it for your website to
ensure your users have snappy interactions.

## What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

INP is a metric that evaluates how quickly a page visually responds to certain
user interactions.

As a Core Web Vital, Google will use INP as one of the signals that influence
your website's search ranking. The upcoming change is expected to provide a more
accurate assessment of a user's experience on a page compared to FID. And the
numbers back this up — 99.9% of desktop and 93.2% of mobile sites passed FID
with flying colors, but this was mostly because it only measured a _portion_ of
the user's _first interaction_ on a page.

## How is INP Measured?

Throughout the lifespan of a user's visit to a page, each click, tap, and key
press is timed from its beginning to the moment a **visual update** occurs. This
elapsed time represents the **interaction's latency**. When the user leaves the
page, the INP score is calculated based on one of the recorded interaction
latencies.

Notably, the visual update doesn't _need_ to be the final desired visual state.
INP is only concerned with the time it takes to present the **next frame**
following an interaction. The frame _can_ show an **intermediate state** like a
spinner. As long as the interaction results in timely visual feedback that shows
the user _something_ has happened, good INP scores can be achieved. Just make
sure you use the
[best progress indicator for the situation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/).

import inpSpinner from "./_assets/inp-progress-indicator.png";

Intuitively, the page's longest interaction latency is often used as the INP.
The exception is when a user performs over 50 interactions. In this case, the
highest interaction for every 50 interactions is ignored, hopefully reducing
extreme outliers. This might happen with single-page applications (SPAs), for
example.

As with other Core Web Vitals, the **75th percentile** of all the page views is
then reported, further reducing noise.

## What's a good INP score?

At the **75th percentile** for any given page and segmented across desktop and
mobile devices:

- INP \<= **200 milliseconds** indicates a page has **good responsiveness**
- INP \<= **500 milliseconds** indicates a page **needs improvement**
- INP \> **500 milliseconds** indicates a page has **poor responsiveness**

## What interactions does INP measure?

INP measures the following interactions:

- Mouse clicks
- Taps on touchscreens
- Key presses (physical and onscreen)

It does NOT measure:

- Hovering
- Scrolling

## How to measure INP?

## What can happen during an interaction?

INP contains **three phases**:

1. **Input delay**: Begins at the moment a user clicks, taps, or presses a key
   to the moment at which JavaScript event callbacks start executing
2. **Processing time**: The total execution time of the event callbacks
3. **Presentation delay**: Begins at the moment the event callbacks complete to
   the moment that a visual update occurs

import inpComponents from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-components.png";

<Image

Each of these phases can add time to the interaction's latency. Part of the
reason why First Input Delay rarely failed was because it only measured the
**input delay** portion of the user's first interaction. Because INP measures
all the way to the first frame a user can see, it is much better indicator of a
user's experience.

## What causes poor responsiveness?

Slow interactions are primarily caused by long tasks. These tasks refer to
discrete units of work carried out by the browser, including:

- HTML parsing
- Stylesheet parsing
- JavaScript execution

rendering, layout, and parsing and executing JavaScript.

If there are no long tasks on the main thread, your INP scores (and the user
experience) and the user experience will improve.

- Always try to do the least amount of work on the main thread
- Split up long tasks into smaller tasks

JavaScript and rendering are the two biggest contributors of large tasks.

## How to Optimize Interaction to Next Paint

A slow INP can be caused by many reasons, but let's go over some of the most
popular ones.

## Optimizing Input delay

### Watch out for page load and rehydration

### Do as little work as possible

### Yield to main thread

### Watch out for recurring long tasks

### Move third party code to web workers

### Task prioritization

### Be careful with `<script defer>`

### Reduce recurring timers

## Optimizing Processing time

### Use debouncing or throttling

E.g. typing into input box

### Eliminate Layout Thrashing

### Show progress

## Optimizing presentation delay
