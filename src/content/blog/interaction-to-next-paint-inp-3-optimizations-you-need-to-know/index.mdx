## What is Interaction to Next Paint?

There are **three phases** that make up INP:

1. **Input delay**
2. **Processing time**
3. **Presentation delay**

import inpComponents from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-components.png";

Each of these phases contributes to the total interaction latency.

## How is Interaction to Next Paint Measured?

INP only measures the following interactions:

- Mouse clicks
- Taps on a touchscreen
- Key presses

It does NOT measure:

- Hovering
- Scrolling

## How is INP different from First Input Delay (FID)?

Unlike First Input Delay which only measured the input delay portion of the
_first_ interaction on a page, INP observes the all interactions made on the
page and reports the one with the worst latency. To reduce noise on pages with
over 50 interactions, the highest interaction for every 50 interactions is
ignored.

## How is INP different from Total Blocking Time (TBT)?

## What's a good Interaction to Next Paint score?
