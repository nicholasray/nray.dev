Around **35% of mobile websites are projected to fail** Google's new measurement
for responsiveness to user interactions, **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**.

Replacing the **First Input Delay (FID)** Core Web Vital on **March 2024**, INP
will factor into your website's search ranking. The upcoming change is expected
to provide a more accurate assessment of a user's experience on a page compared
to FID, which most websites — 99.9% of desktop and 93.2% of mobile sites —
passed with flying colors since it only measured a _portion_ of the user's first
interaction on a page.

Users expect that when they interact with a page by clicking a button, tapping a
menu item, or pressing a key, visual feedback happens — **and occurs quickly**.
INP captures the total time that an interaction takes to produce a visual update
and flags interactions that result in a poor user experience.

This article explains what exactly INP measures and how you can optimize it. But
first, let's define INP.

## What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

INP is a metric that evaluates a page's overall responsiveness to user
interactions. It measures the elapsed time between the start of a user's
interaction and the point at which there is a visual update.

It's important to know that the visual update doesn't necessarily need to be the
final desired visual state. Showing an intermediate state like a spinner is
sufficient for INP as long as the spinner is quickly shown. But from a user
experience standpoint make sure you use the
[best progress indicator for the situation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/).

## How is INP Measured?

Throughout the lifespan of a user's visit to a page, clicks, taps, and keyboard
press interactions are timed from the moment they are initiated to the moment a
visual update occurs. When the user leaves the page, the INP score is calculated
for that page.

For pages that do not have over 50 interactions, **the longest interaction is
used as the INP score**. Otherwise, in an attempt to reduce outliers, the
highest interaction for every 50 interactions is ignored.

As with other Core Web Vitals, the **75th percentile** of all the page views is
then reported, further reducing noise.

## What's a good INP score?

At the **75th percentile** for any given page and segmented across desktop and
mobile devices, an INP score that is:

- \<= **200 milliseconds** indicates a page has **good** responsiveness
- \<= **500 milliseconds** indicates a page **needs improvement**
- \> **500 milliseconds** indicates a page has **poor responsiveness**

## What interactions does INP measure?

INP measures the following interactions:

- Mouse clicks
- Taps on a touchscreen
- Key presses

It does NOT measure:

- Hovering
- Scrolling

## What can happen during an interaction?

INP contains **three phases**:

1. **Input delay**: Begins at the moment a user clicks, taps, or presses a key
   to the moment at which JavaScript event callbacks start to execute (if any)
2. **Processing time**: The total execution time of the event callbacks
3. **Presentation delay**: Begins at the moment the event callbacks complete to
   the moment that a visual update occurs

Each of these phases takes time and the sum of these phases is the interaction's
latency. Therefore, it's import

## How to Optimize Interaction to Next Paint

## Input delay

### Be careful with `<script defer>`

### Reduce recurring timers

## Processing time

### Eliminate Layout Thrashing

### Show progress

## Presentation delay
