  Why Astro is better than Next.js for static, content-heavy websites.
publishedAt: 2024-04-05

I've been using the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) to create
mostly static websites (like this one) for a while, dating back to
around its 1.0 release. During this time, I've also spent months
experimenting with the much more popular Next.js framework, which is
used by companies like Spotify, OpenAI, Nike, and more.

But I keep returning to Astro.

I have yet to find a better framework for static or content-heavy
websites. In this post, I'll explain why I prefer Astro (version 4.5)
and how it outperforms Next.js (version 14.1) for this use case.

## Zero JS, unless you add it

I want a scalable framework.

Something that easily allows me to add interactivity to a page when
needed but also lets me scale **down** to a primarily static site like
landing pages, blogs, and portfolios.

I've written about how adding client-side JavaScript to a site is
[one of the fastest ways to slow it down](/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/).
To that end, a framework shouldn't make assumptions about how much
JavaScript your site needs. **You should make that call, not the
framework**.

import blankPage from "./_assets/astro-vs-nextjs-js-on-blank-page.png";

<Image

  caption="Next.js loads 87 KB of JavaScript (after compression) on a blank white page. Astro loads zero JavaScript."
/>

Because of its client-side router and dependence on React.js (among
other things), Next.js will load a minimum of **87 KB** of JavaScript
(after compression) — _even if your page is blank_. How much
JavaScript does Astro load for that same page?

Zero. Nada. Zilch.

Astro will only load JS that you tell it to load. And that's what I
expect.

<Aside heading="Zero JS Next.js?">
    There's an [open
    discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/45174)
    proposing that Next.js have a zero JS option. Although it has yet to see
    much traction at the time of this writing, I'd love to see it!
    
    It's also worth noting that Next.js *has* made progress towards
    reducing client-side JavaScript with their recent
    implementation of [React Server
    Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).
    IMHO, this is a significant step in the right direction.

</Aside>

If you want to add more interactivity to a page, Astro lets you use
vanilla JS, a UI library like React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, HTMX, or
even a combination of any of those. It's UI-agnostic and defers that
decision to you. In contrast, Next.js is a React-first framework that
advertises itself as "The React Framework for the Web."

## Server first

Astro and Next.js differ in how they handle routing. Next.js
encourages you to use their
[`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link)
component when linking to other pages. It uses client-side JavaScript
to re-render the part of the page that has changed, avoiding a full
page refresh. By default, this component can make navigating a website
feel very snappy because it also **prefetches** the page the link
points to when the link enters the viewport.

On the other hand, Astro doesn't provide any special link component,
instead relying on the standard old `<a href="">` tag to leverage the
browser's innate ability to perform navigation. With this method, the
browser performs a full page refresh, rendering the HTML _on the
server_. Astro doesn't prefetch any link by default, but a simple
[configuration change](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/prefetch/)
will enable it. With this change, you can closely mimic Next.js's fast
page navigations.

So which approach is better?

For simple or content-heavy sites that don't require the app-like
functionality that client-side navigation offers, I prefer Astro's
approach:

- By using client-side navigation, Next.js must re-implement
  navigation features in JavaScript that the standard anchor tag and
  browser already provide **for free**. These include essential
  accessibility features like a
  [route announcer](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/accessibility#route-announcements)
  to notify users with accessibility issues that the page has loaded.
  And have you ever noticed the loading indicator browsers show you
  after you click a standard link that tells you the page is loading?
  Well, with client-side navigation, **you are responsible for adding
  that behavior**. Otherwise, a user who clicks a link while on a slow
  connection won't be able to tell that anything is happening. In
  addition to frustrating your users, this lack of feedback may also
  negatively affect your
  [Interaction to Next Paint](/blog/interaction-to-next-paint-inp-everything-you-need-to-know/)
  score. Next.js does let you add a
  [`loading.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)
  file you can use to implement a loading indicator, but why go
  through the trouble of reinventing these critical features when HTML
  and browsers already provide robust solutions?
- On a related note, relying on the browser to perform something as
  critical as navigation is safer than relying on a JavaScript
  framework. Even at the time of this writing, Next.js has a
  [long-standing bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/45187)
  that causes the browser to not scroll to the top of the page after
  navigation in certain situations. Meanwhile, browsers have spent
  decades perfecting idiosyncrasies like this.
- Offloading HTML rendering to the server can make your website more
  responsive to users on low-powered devices like cheap cell phones
  that can struggle to run heavy JavaScript. Mobile users often
  comprise most of a website's traffic, so this demographic should be
  considered unless your analytics suggest otherwise.

<Aside heading="Can't I just use the standard anchor link in Next.js?">
  You can use the standard anchor element in Next.js
  instead of the `<Link>` to mitigate these issues. But Next.js will
  still load all the JavaScript for client-side navigation even if you don't use
  it. If you choose to do this, you'll also lose out on the prefetching feature. Not ideal.
</Aside>

Even if you find your website needing client-side navigation down the
road, Astro allows you to imitate this behavior through
[View transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/).

## Content first

Try adding a blog to an Astro and Next.js site or compare the
[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
with the
[Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)
on the topic, and you'll quickly realize that content is much more of
a first-class citizen in Astro.

After trying both out, I found that Astro has better out-of-the-box
support for the following:

- Defining and querying content. Seriously, Astro's
  [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
  are fantastic.
- Using and validating frontmatter
- Adding image references to frontmatter, such as a cover photo
- Syntax highlighting
- Data formats like JSON and YAML. Useful for referential data, like
  author information or related content, that you don't want to store
  in a database but that belongs on each piece of content.

Don't get me wrong — you _can_ workaround these issues in Next.js if
you're motivated enough. But it made me feel like I was jumping
through hoops that the framework should provide more help with.

## Conclusion

In summary, I love using Astro because it takes advantage of what is
already built on the web platform, provides an excellent developer
experience when authoring content, and doesn't load any JavaScript by
default. If you're creating a mostly static site, I highly recommend
it.
