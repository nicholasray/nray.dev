If you run a PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse audit on your site, you
might get an "**Efficiently encode images" warning**."

You'll get this warning if you have one or more JPEG or BMP images
that could have been at least 4 KiB smaller using a compression level
of 85.

Generally, you need to decrease the file size of your images by
**increasing their compression**. Using compression with
[next-gen image formats](http://localhost:3000/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/)
will usually give you the best combination of performance and visual
quality.

In this article, I'll explain your options for passing this audit.

## Why does this matter?

As of July 2023, images are responsible for
[40% of the total downloaded bytes](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesImg)
when visiting the median website. And with most pages serving
[at least one image over 100 KB](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/media#bytesizes),
reducing the file size of your images can mean:

- Faster load times
- Less cellular data that mobile users pay for
- More bandwidth available to download other assets on the page
  required for rendering
- Better [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) times and
  perceptual performance

## What is compression?

**Compression** is a technique to **make a file size smaller** by
removing its data. There are two types of compression:

- **Lossless compression**: Removes **redundant** data to **preserve
  the same visual quality**.
- **Lossy compression**: Removes less important data to produce an
  approximation of the original image. Unlike lossless compression,
  increasing lossy compression _can_ **decrease the visual quality**
  of an image.

<Aside heading="Just use lossless compression for everything?">
  **Typically**, using lossy compression rather than lossless results
  in **smaller file sizes** with acceptable image quality, so that is
  generally preferred from a performance standpoint. Of course, it
  depends on the use case — lossless compression may be the best
  choice for a photographer who may not want any degradation in their
  photos. Depending on the image's content, there can be exceptions
  where lossless compression actually results in a smaller file size
  than lossy can produce at a comparable quality.
</Aside>

[Modern formats like WebP and AVIF](/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/)
typically outperform JPEG and PNG in generating smaller files with
acceptable quality because they use more efficient compression
algorithms. Their biggest downside is that they have less browser
support, so you need a
[strategy to serve them](/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/#how-do-i-serve-webp-or-avif).

| Format | Lossy or Lossless | Browser support                                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| PNG    | Lossless          | ~100%                                           |
| JPEG   | Lossy             | ~100%                                           |
| WebP   | Both              | > 96% (See [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webp)) |
| AVIF   | Both              | > 84% (See [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/avif)) |

To optimize images with compression, you must find the **right
balance** between **small file size** and **excellent image quality**.
A small file size means little if the image is too blurry or pixelated
to see. And perfect image quality is irrelevant if it takes too long
to download. At either extreme, the user won't see the image. There
needs to be a balance.

So how do you compress images?

## How to efficiently encode images

### Option 1: Manually compress each image

If your site has a small number of images, you can use a tool like
[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to manually adjust the image's format
(taking into account
[compatibility issues](/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/#how-do-i-serve-webp-or-avif))
and compression level.

import squooshAvif from "./_assets/squoosh-avif.mp4";

<Video

  width="1064"
  height="1080"
  src={[squooshAvif]}
  caption="Manual compression with Squoosh is good when you have a simple site with a small number of images."
/>

Ironically, while manually compressing each image one by one can
produce small and efficient images, the process itself isn't
efficient, can take a lot of time, and is easy to forget. Because of
that, I only recommend manual compression for simple sites with few
images. Otherwise, using automation is preferable.

### Option 2: Compress images automatically

A step up from manually reviewing each image is to let a tool,
library, or plugin do it for you. A drag-and-drop tool like
[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (only for Mac) can compress
multiple files using either lossy or lossless compression.

import imageOptim from "./_assets/image-optim.mp4";

<Video
  description="An example workflow with ImageOptim where a compressed JPEG image is saved."
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[imageOptim]}
  caption="ImageOptim can compress multiple files automatically."
/>

If you have a CMS like WordPress, an
[image optimization plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/optimize+images/)
that converts to modern formats and compresses uploads can work.

For people who don't mind writing code, an image optimization library
like [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) used in a build script
is another popular option.

### Option 3: Use an image CDN to handle everything

My favorite way to optimize websites with many images is with an image
CDN.

Image CDNs are typically not free, but they can take a lot off your
plate while reducing the size of your images by
[40-80%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGCZCaIZkQ&t=1010s). They
can:

1. Choose the **best compatible format** (AVIF, WebP, JPEG)
2. **Transform and optimize** with great compression automatically
3. Serve images **close to your users** to minimize latency

In short, image CDNs specialize in making images fast.

One of the best parts is that you probably don't have to do a huge
migration process to start using one. Many offer the option to keep
the images hosted on your server (unless you'd prefer to move them to
their server). For example, look at the following `img` tag:

```html
<img
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/fetch/w_500/f_auto,q_auto/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Benedict_Cumberbatch_2011.png"
  alt="Photo of Benedict Cumberbatch"
  width="500"
  heihgt="616"
/>
```

The URL in the `src` attribute will:

1. Make a request to Cloudinary's server
   (`https://res.cloudinary.com...`)
2. Ask Cloudinary to automatically pick the best compatible format
   (`f_auto`) and quality (`q_auto`) at a resized width of 500 pixels
   (`w_500`)
3. When Cloudinary gets the request, it will fetch the original image
   from `https://upload.wikimedia.org...`

<Aside heading="Be careful with the `src` attribute">
  Since it is not your domain, using `res.cloudinary.com` for the
  `src` attribute (as in the example) will cause the browser to set up
  a new connection, which can easily take over 500 ms. For the fastest
  load times, try to [set up a
  proxy](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-11-17-netlify-proxy-requests/)
  that avoids the extra connection cost.
</Aside>

That image is stored on Wikipedia's server — not on Cloudinary. You'll
see the result if you copy and paste this URL into your browser. You
can even change the `w_500` to another number to see it dynamically
resize.

import cloudinary from "./_assets/cloudinary-demo.mp4";

<Video
  description="Visiting an address of an image whose width, quality, and format is transformed by Cloudinary."
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[cloudinary]}
  caption="Image CDNs like Cloudinary can transform images to a different size using the best format and compression automatically."
/>

And although the original image was a PNG, Cloudinary sent back an
AVIF with better compression by using
[content negotiation](/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/#option-3-serve-different-formats-with-content-negotiation):

import cloudinaryAvif from "./_assets/cloudinary-avif-transform.png";

<Image
  src={cloudinaryAvif}
  alt="Cloudinary converts a image originally in PNG format to an AVIF."
  caption="Image CDNs like Cloudinary can convert to modern and smaller image formats if the browser supports them."
/>

There are many image CDNs out there. Your website may already be on a
CDN that offers an image optimization service. Some of the more
popular image CDNs include:

- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)
- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/products/image-optimization)
- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/products/image-and-video-manager)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- [imgix](https://imgix.com/)

## Conclusion

Picking the proper format and compression level results in faster
loading images and a better user experience. Whether using manual
tools like Squoosh or automation via libraries, plugins, or image
CDNs, these strategies ensure a faster, visually appealing, and
user-friendly website.
