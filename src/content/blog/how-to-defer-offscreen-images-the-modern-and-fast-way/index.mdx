import Image from "@components/BlogImage.astro";

So you run a Lighthouse or [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
audit on your website, and it complains that you should "**Defer offscreen
images**", advising you to "**lazy-load offscreen and hidden images**". Great!
🎉

import lighthouseMessage from "./_assets/lighthouse-defer-offscreen-images-message.png";

<Image
  src={lighthouseMessage}
  alt="Lighthouse report that shows a failed 'defer offscreen images' audit."
  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>

But what does that mean? Unfortunately, the "Learn more" link at the end of the
message takes you to an outdated page.

In this article, I'll explain what lazy-loaded images are and how to fix this
message with the latest best practices from **2023**.

## What are lazy-loaded images?

Usually, the browser will load **all** images it finds in your page's HTML or
CSS when it loads.

But lazy-loaded images don't begin loading until they are within or near the
browser's viewport — the rectangular area you see on the screen. Their loading
is **deferred** until they are **needed**.

So if a user visits a website with images that are offscreen, the browser won't
download them. It will only load a lazy-loaded image when the browser scrolls
near it.

## Why can't I load all my images during page load?

In short, it's a waste of resources. It leads to:

- **Longer load times**
- **Higher mobile phone data costs for your users**
- **Higher bandwidth costs for you and the host of your website**
- **Browser resources that could have potentially been used for other (more
  important) things**

According to HTTP Archive, images are
[the most popular asset on the web](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images),
so it's essential to load them efficiently.

What does that look like?

## How to lazy-load images

### Use native lazy loading

There was a time when JavaScript was the only method for lazy loading images.
Then browsers implemented a way to do it using an HTML attribute. But browser
support wasn't good, so most websites continued to use JavaScript.

Well, times have changed. **All modern browsers now support lazy loading**,
including Safari. Browser support is currently
[93% of global users](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr), which is good
enough for most websites. All you have to do is add a `loading="lazy"` attribute
to each image you want lazy-loaded:

```html /loading="lazy"/
<!-- below-the-fold image -->
<img src="image.png" loading="lazy" alt="…" width="500" height="500" />
```

Browsers that don't support the attribute will ignore it and load images the
default way — during page load — so it
[degrades gracefully](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation).

As of July 2023, only around
[27% of desktop and mobile sites](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#imgLazy)
are using this feature. The rest either load their images during page load or
use JavaScript to lazy-load them. But JavaScript can cause
[responsiveness](/blog/interaction-to-next-paint-inp-everything-you-need-to-know/)
[issues](/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/), so it's
better to use the HTML attribute when possible.

That's it! But keep reading because there are some caveats.

### Don't lazy-load images above the fold

**You should only lazy-load images that are "below the fold" — the part of the
page that is hidden before scrolling.**

Images that are **above the fold** will load quicker by omitting the `loading`
attribute:

```html /loading="lazy"/
<!-- above-the-fold image -->
<img src="image.png" alt="…" width="500" height="500" />
```

Why? Using the `loading="lazy"` attribute for images above the fold will
unnecessarily delay when they start loading since the browser must first load
all of the page's CSS to determine whether the image is near the viewport.
Omitting the attribute allows the browser to start loading them as soon as it
finds them in the HTML, even before loading any CSS, which means the user can
see them faster.

Finding above-the-fold images can be tricky since "the fold" is relative to the
device — images that appear above the fold on laptops are not necessarily above
the fold on mobile devices. My advice? Use your website's most popular viewport
sizes on desktop and mobile devices and your better judgment to determine which
images you should lazy-load.

Following this advice will make your above-the-fold images load relatively
quickly, but what if some images above-the-fold are more important than others?

### Optimize the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image

[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) is a Core Web Vital
metric that measures how quickly the largest **image** or **text block** becomes
visible within the viewport. Images are the
[most common type of LCP element](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance#lcp-content-types).

Omitting the `loading="lazy"` attribute for above-the-fold images within the
viewport is a good start to better LCP scores, but you can do more:

1. Find the largest image that is above the fold
2. Add a `fetchpriority="high"` attribute to it:

```html /fetchpriority="high"/
<!-- LCP image -->
<img src="image.png" fetchpriority="high" alt="…" width="200" height="200" />
```

The `fetchpriority="high"` attribute signals to the browser that the image is
more important than the other images. **But only use this attribute for the
largest above-the-fold image on the page.** Prioritizing many images can lead to
bandwidth contention, which defeats the purpose of prioritization.

Note that [browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=fetchpriority) for this
attribute isn't good right now, but browsers that don't support it will ignore
it.

## How to lazy-load background images

Native lazy loading **doesn't work** for images in CSS that use the
`background-image` property:

```css
.image {
  /* Can't lazy-load without JS */
  background-image: url("image.png");
}
```

If you want to lazy-load background images, you will need another strategy.
First, consider replacing the background image with an image that uses the
`object-fit: cover` CSS property and uses native lazy loading:

```html
<img
  class="image"
  src="image.png"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="…"
  width="200"
  height="200"
/>
```

```css /object-fit: cover;/
.image {
  /* Mimics background-image property */
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

If this isn't possible (and make sure it isn't because most of the time it is),
you will need to use JavaScript. The most efficient way to do it is to use
`IntersecionObserver` to remove a class:

```html
<div class="bg-image lazy"></div>
```

```css
.bg-image {
  width: 500px;
  height: 500px;
  background-image: url("image.png");
}

.lazy {
  /* Overrides the preceding `background-image`. */
  /* Prevents loading the image until IntersectionObserver removes the .lazy class. */
  background-image: none;
}
```

```js
// Get all background image elements with the .lazy class.
const images = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(".lazy"));

// Check if browser supports IntersectionObserver.
if (window.IntersectionObserver) {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      // If element is within the viewport, load its background image.
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        // Load background image by removing the .lazy class.
        entry.target.classList.remove("lazy");
        // Stop observing an element whose image will already be loaded.
        observer.unobserve(entry.target);
      }
    });
  });

  images.forEach((image) => {
    observer.observe(image);
  });
}
```

## Defer offscreen images in WordPress

Since
[WordPress 5.5](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/14/lazy-loading-images-in-5-5/),
images with `width` and `height` attributes are automatically lazy-loaded
without the need for additional plugins. It uses native lazy loading to
accomplish this.

## Conclusion

Deferring your offscreen images is now easier than ever with native lazy loading
in the browser. Just keep in mind these constraints:

- Lazy-load images with the native `loading="lazy"` attribute
- Only lazy-load below-the-fold images. Above-the-fold images should not have
  the `loading` attribute.
- Improve your LCP time (in supporting browsers) by adding
  `fetchpriority="high"` to the LCP image.
- Native lazy loading doesn't work for background images. Either replace with an
  image element or use `IntersectionObserver` to lazy-load those.

Here's a **cheatsheet** summarizing most of this:

```html
<!-- above-the-fold LCP image -->
<img src="image.png" fetchpriority="high" alt="…" width="500" height="500" />

<!-- above-the-fold image that isn't the LCP -->
<img src="image.png" alt="…" width="500" height="500" />

<!-- below-the-fold image -->
<img src="image.png" loading="lazy" alt="…" width="500" height="500" />

<!-- below-the-fold background image, will require additional JS and CSS -->
<div class="bg-image lazy"></div>
```
