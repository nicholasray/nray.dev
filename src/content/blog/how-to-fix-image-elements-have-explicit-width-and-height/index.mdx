[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and Lighthouse audits
will flag any "unsized" image with the message, "**Image elements do
not have explicit width and height**."

import psi from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-fail-explicit-width-and-height.png";

<Image
  src={psi}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a failing `Image elements do not have explicit width and height` audit."
  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>

So how do you fix it?

Generally, **you need to add `width` and `height` attributes to each
image** so the browser knows its **aspect ratio** before loading it:

```html /width="704" height="469"/
<img width="704" height="469" src="…" alt="…" />
```

In this post, you'll learn how to fix an image failing this audit.

## Why does this matter?

By default, browsers only allocate space for an image **after** it has
downloaded its dimensions. Before that point, the image doesn't occupy
any space on the page.

This becomes a problem if the browser renders a page **before** it
knows the aspect ratio of an image in the viewport. Why? After the
browser figures out the image's aspect ratio, it will allocate space
for it by **pushing down** all the elements and text below it, causing
a [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS).

import CLS from "./_assets/cumulative-layout-shift-example.mp4";

<Video

  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLS]}
  caption="Loading a page with an unsized image causes a large Cumulative Layout Shift after the browser renders the image."
/>

You may have experienced annoying layout shifts when visiting websites
with ads that load late and push down other elements on the page.
Trying to read text or interact with an element that gets shifted,
like a button, can be incredibly annoying. Layout shifts like these
[frustrate users](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html).

Now, let's look at an example.

## Step 1: Measure the baseline

Let's start by running a PageSpeed Insights audit of
[this demo page](/demos/how-to-fix-image-elements-have-explicit-width-and-height/before/),
featuring an unsized image with some text below. What are the results?

- **CLS**: 0.223
- **Total**: 89

import psiBefore from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-before.png";

<Image
  src={psiBefore}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing an 89 total score and 0.223 Cumulative Layout Shift."
/>

## Step 2: Add `width` and `height` attributes and CSS

### Fixing `<img>` elements

Get the image's dimensions in pixels and add `width` and `height`
attributes to the image with these values. Make sure to not include
the `px` unit. Because the image in the demo has a width of 704 px and
a height of 469 px, the HTML should look like the following:

```html /width="704" height="469"/
<img width="704" height="469" src="…" alt="…" />
```

<Aside heading="`width` and `height` values">
  Although using the image's actual dimensions for the `width` and
  `height` attributes is usually easier, you don't need to. The values
  just need to be proportional so the browser can calculate the
  image's aspect ratio. In other words, if an image's natural size has
  a width of 1000 pixels and a height of 500 pixels, you could also
  use `width="2"` and `height="1"` because 2 / 1 is proportional to
  1000 / 500.
</Aside>

And then add some CSS:

```css
img {
  /* Allow the image's height to scale to the aspect ratio inferred
   * from the `width` and `height` attributes */
  height: auto;
  /* Make the image fill the width of the container */
  width: 100%;
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the
[`aspect-ratio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio)
CSS property instead of adding the `width` and `height` attributes:

```html {6}
<img class="hero" src="…" alt="…" />
```

```css
.hero {
  aspect-ratio: 704 / 469;
  height: auto;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Fixing `<picture>` elements

You can also apply `width` and `height` attributes to the images using
the `<picture>` element. For example, you could use the `<picture>`
element to
[serve different formats](/blog/how-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/#option-2-serve-different-formats-with-html):

```html /width="704" height="469"/
<picture>
  <!-- Load the AVIF, if supported  -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="…" />
  <!-- Otherwise, load the WebP, if supported -->
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="…" />
  <!-- Fallback to the JPEG from the <img> element -->
  <img src="fallback.jpg" width="704" height="469" alt="…" />
</picture>
```

If the aspect ratio remains constant for all the `<source>` elements,
you don't need to add `width` and `height` attributes to each one. But
if the aspect ratio changes, there is good
[browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_source_width)
for that, too:

```html {6-7, 13-14}
<picture>
  <!-- Use square image on smaller screens  -->
  <source
    media="(max-width: 999px)"
    srcset="…"
    width="500"
    height="500"
  />
  <!-- Use rectangle image on larger screens  -->
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1000px)"
    srcset="…"
    width="704"
    height="469"
  />
  <!-- Fallback to using the rectangle image  -->
  <img src="fallback.jpg" width="704" height="469" alt="…" />
</picture>
```

## Step 2: Measure the impact

With the `width`, `height`, and CSS added, let's use PageSpeed
Insights to measure the impact of a
[page after these changes](/demos/how-to-fix-image-elements-have-explicit-width-and-height/after/):

- **CLS**: 0
- **Total**: 100

import psiAfter from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-after.png";

<Image
  src={psiAfter}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a 100 total score and 0 Cumulative Layout Shift."
/>

That's better! We've eliminated the Cumulative Layout Shift, and the
page has a perfect score. Sometimes, minor CSS and HTML changes like
these can go a long way in improving the user's experience.
