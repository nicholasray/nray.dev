  "CSS now offers an experimental property that eliminates awkward-looking
  headlines."

So you have headlines on your site that wrap only one or two words to the next
line at a certain breakpoint, looking **uneven** and **awkward**. They would
look much better if they were **balanced** â€” the amount of text on each line
should be about the same when it wraps.

import Image from "@components/BlogImage.astro";
import comparison from "./_assets/unbalanced-text-vs-balanced-text.png";

<Image
  src={comparison}
  alt="A comparison of an unbalanced vs. balanced heading. The unbalanced heading has one word that awkwardly wraps to the next line, while the balanced text has two lines of text closer to the same width."
/>

Now there's a way with CSS:

```css title="styles.css"
h1 {
  text-wrap: balance;
  /* You need to set a max-width as well, but it doesn't need to be 1000px */
  max-width: 1000px;
}
```

I'm using it for the headline of my articles â€” resize the window to see it in
action.

## Advantages

Before using this, you had to either:

- Do nothing. ðŸ™ˆ
- Use JavaScript like the 2.2 KB
  [balance-text](https://github.com/adobe/balance-text) library. But even a
  small amount of JS can
  [slow down](/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/) a
  page.
- Manually place
  [`<wbr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr) or
  [`&shy;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens) tags at
  the positions you want the browser to break a line. But that's tedious.

## Limitations

### Browser support

It's an **experimental property** that currently has
[limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=text-wrap%20balance).

Mainly, only recent versions of Chrome and Edge support it. Still, I'd rather
half of the population see nice headings than 0%.

### Don't go wild with it

Using this property for a small number of elements is fine. Even the following
could work:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

But don't try to balance every line of text on the page because it will slow
down its rendering performance.

The browser needs to do a _lot_ of work to balance the text, so use it
**sparingly**.

### It only works for a few lines

The [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#text-wrap) allows browsers to skip
balancing if there are more than ten lines of text. Chromium browsers will only
balance 4 lines or less.

So applying it to headings and pull quotes are the best use case.

### Conflicts with `white-space` property

The following won't work as they are contradicting properties:

```css
h1 {
  white-space: nowrap;
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

The `white-space` property instructs the browser not to wrap the text, while
`text-wrap` tells the browser it's okay. The result is unbalanced text.

To balance the text, remove the `white-space` property.
