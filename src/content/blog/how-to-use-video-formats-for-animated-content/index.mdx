Despite the popularity of animated GIFs on the web, they're often
humongous in file size and slow to load. Because of this, Lighthouse
and [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) audits will flag
any animated GIF that's
[over 100 KiB](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/f33cf9375583c384efa4379d55df1f1936406d2b/core/audits/byte-efficiency/efficient-animated-content.js#L63)
with the warning message "**Use video formats for animated content**".

import psi from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-fail-animated-gif.png";

<Image
  src={psi}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a failing `Use video formats for animated content` audit."
  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>

What's the solution?

1. **Replace all animated GIFs with optimized videos**.
2. **Never use GIFs again**.

In this post, I'll show you how to cut the size of a **2.5 MB GIF**
down to a **69 KB video** while also improving load and
[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) times.

## Why does this matter?

Animated GIFs are usually
[much bigger](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/4696#issuecomment-370979920)
than videos which can result in:

- Slower LCP times
- Longer load times
- Less bandwidth available to download other assets on the page
- More cellular data that mobile users pay for

How do we fix this? Let's run through an example.

## Step 1: Measure the baseline GIF

We'll start with an animated GIF from
[this demo page](/demos/use-video-instead-of-gif-before/). In the
demo, I've used a Homer Simpson animated GIF above the fold. There's
nothing else that captures embarrassment and awkwardness into one
easy-to-use image. What's not to love?

Unfortunately, PageSpeed Insights doesn't find it amusing.

import animatedGifBaseline from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-animated-gif-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={animatedGifBaseline}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a 75 performance score, 14.2 second Largest Contentful Paint, and a `Use video formats for animated content` warning."
/>

Let's see how it fares using
[WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/). I'll use the following
settings:

- **Test Location**: Virginia, EC2
- **Browser**: Chrome on emulated Motorola G (gen 4)
- **Connection**: 4G (9 Mbps, 170ms RTT)
- **Number of Test to Run**: 9

import webPageTestBaseline from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaseline}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 3.646 Largest Contentful Paint"
/>

import webPageTestBaselineWaterfall from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline-waterfall.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaselineWaterfall}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 2.7 second load time for the animated GIF"
  caption="The animated GIF loaded in 2.7 seconds"
/>

The [results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230826_AiDc13_9FX/)
show:

- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 1.3 seconds\*
- **Page Weight**: 2,442 KB
- **Load time**: 3.616 seconds

<Aside heading="*Largest Contentful Paint for autoplaying video or animated GIF">
  As of [August
  2023](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered), the first
  frame of an autoplaying video or animated GIF can be the Largest
  Contentful Paint element. But WebPageTest erroneously reports the
  LCP as 3.646 seconds for these results. Presumably, this is because
  it's using an older definition.
</Aside>

## Step 2: Convert to MP4 and WebM video formats

We need to convert the animated GIF to video. But which format should
we pick? MP4 has the best browser support, but WebM results in smaller
file sizes and less support.

| Format | Browser support                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| MP4    | > 96.2% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mpeg4)) |
| WebM   | > 95.8% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webm))  |

You'll need to decide whether only serving WebM offers enough browser
support for your audience. Or you can offer both options and let the
browser decide — that's the approach we'll take in this example.

### Option 1: Use FFmpeg

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a popular command-line tool for
converting video. We can use the following command to convert to MP4:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -vf "crop=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" -b:v 0 -crf 25 -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p homer-simpson.mp4
```

And use this command to convert to WebM:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 homer-simpson.webm
```

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 122 KB   | 80 KB     |

By converting the GIF to video with FFMpeg, we reduced the file size
by **95%** when converted to MP4 and by **97%** when converted to
WebM.

If you only have a few videos on your site, you can get great results
just by manually converting GIFs with the preceeding commands. But I
recommend using automation for anything more than that.

### Option 2: Use an image CDN

Because video and
[image](/blog/how-to-efficiently-encode-images/#option-3-use-an-image-cdn-to-handle-everything)
optimization can be a pain at scale, I like to delegate these
responsibilities to an image CDN service like
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Although image CDNs are
typically not free, they can save a lot of hassle with media
management and produce great results.

After uploading the image to Cloudinary, you can dynamically convert
it to MP4 by replacing the `.gif` file extension with `.mp4`:

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.mp4
```

Similarly, use the `.webm` extension in the url to convert to WebM:

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.webm
```

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 88 KB    | 71 KB     |

By converting the GIF to video with Cloudinary, we reduced the file
size by **96%** when converted to MP4 and by over **97%** when
converted to WebM.

## Step 3: Replace `img` element with `video` element

Instead of using the `<img>` element to serve a GIF, we'll use the
`<video>` element which supports serving different formats using the
[source element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source).

```html
<video>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

By using two `source` elements, we allow the browser to use the WebM
format if it supports it and fallback to MP4 if it doesn't.

<Aside heading="Order matters">
It's important to put the lightest format **on top** as the browser
will use the first supported format starting from the top. Placing the
MP4 `<source>` element on top of the WebM would undesirably cause
browsers that support both formats to use MP4.
</Aside>

GIF offers the ability to autoplay, loop, and play silently which we
can replicate with the `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` attributes for
video:

```html {/autoplay loop muted/}
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width: 100%">
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

I also added the `style` attribute to let the video expand to the
width of the content.

After doing this, our video looks nearly identical to the original
GIF, but with one jarring problem — after the video loads, it shifts
the text down, resulting in a
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS):

import CLS from "./_assets/cumulative-layout-shift-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video results in a large Cumulative Layout Shift"
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLS]}
  caption="The text moves down after the video loads, resulting in a large Cumulative Layout Shift."
/>

The browser doesn't know the aspect ratio of the video until after
it's loaded, and that's what causes the layout shift. What can we do
about this?

## Step 4: Add aspect-ratio CSS

Unlike the `<img>`, we can't just add `width` and `height` attributes
to the video to let the browser figure out the aspect ratio. Actually,
this is supposed to work, but it's
[currently broken](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7524).
To get around this, we can use the
[`aspect-ratio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio)
CSS property instead.

```html {6}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

With the `aspect-ratio` CSS, the browser knows how much space to
allocate for the video before it has even downloaded. As a result,
we've eliminated the layout shift.

import CLSFix from "./_assets/fix-cls-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video with aspect-ratio CSS prevents CLS."
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLSFix]}
  caption="Using `aspect-ratio` CSS prevents a Cumulative Layout Shift after the video loads."
/>

Okay, now we have a video that's a much smaller file size, serves
different formats based on browser support, and doesn't cause a
Cumulative Layout Shift after it loads. Let's examine the WebPageTest
waterfall chart at this point.

import WPTTimelineVideo from "./_assets/web-page-test-timeline-video.png";

<Image
  src={WPTTimelineVideo}
  alt="WebPageTest timeline showing the first frame of the video doesn't render until after the video has been loaded."
/>

Many of the waterfalls show that the video's first frame doesn't paint
until the entire video finishes downloading. Ideally, we want that to
render as quickly as possible to indicate visual progress. As of
[August 2023](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered), this
also affects the Largest Contentful Paint time since it's the first
frame of an autoplaying video.

Luckily, there's another trick we can use for this.

## Step 5: Add poster attribute

We can try to make the first frame render faster by using the
[`poster` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)
which tells the browser to download and display an image while the
video is loading.

Using FFMpeg, you can use the following command to extract the first
frame of the video as an image.

```shell
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -ss 0 -qscale:v 31 -frames:v 1 poster.jpg
```

You can raise the quality by lowering the `qscale:v` param (31 is the
lowest quality while 2 is the best).

And using Cloudinary, you can just set the file extension as a `jpg`
and decrease the file size by adding the `q_10` to the path which
decreases the quality of the image.

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/q_10/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.jpg
```

Given that this image will only show initially, we should apply heavy
compression to it so that it downloads as quickly as possible.
Remember, its only purpose is to indicate visual progress so it's okay
if the quality is on the low side. The poster image I've generated
with Cloudinary results in a **4 KB image**.

Next, add the image to the poster attribute:

```html {7}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
  poster="/poster.jpg"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

Now WebPageTest shows the first frame rendering about **100ms
earlier** for most runs:

import WPTPoster from "./_assets/web-page-test-poster-timeline.png";

<Image
  src={WPTPoster}
  alt="WebPageTest timeline showing the first frame of the video rendering after the poster image has loaded and before the video has finished loading."
/>

Now let's compare the overall peformance impact of using video instead
of GIF.

## Step 6: Measure the impact

Testing the video with PageSpeed Insights results in a perfect score
(25 point improvement).

import PSIResults from "./_assets/psi-results.png";

<Image
  src={PSIResults}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights showing a perfect score when testing the video."
/>

When we compare the GIF and video results from WebPageTest, we see the
following improvements:

- **97% decrease** in **file size** (2,392 KB GIF down to 69 KB video
  with 4 KB poster)
- **95% decrease** in **page weight** (2,442 KB down to 122 KB)
- **100 ms improvement** in **Largest Contentful Paint**
- **65% decrease** in **page load time** (3.616 seconds down to 1.247
  seconds)

import WPTFimstripResults from "./_assets/web-page-test-results-filmstrip.png";

<Image
  src={WPTFimstripResults}
  alt="WebPageTest filmstrip showing the first frame of the video rendering earlier than the first frame of the GIF."
  caption="WebPageTest showing a 100 ms improvement in Largest Contentful Paint for most runs by using a video with a low quality poster instead of a GIF."
/>

## Conclusion

Replacing animated GIFs with optimized videos can significantly
improve your website's performance. Here's how we did it in this post:

- converted and compressed GIF to MP4 and WebM formats
- replaced the `<img>` element with a `<video>` element containing two
  `<source>` elements for browser compatibility
- added `aspect-ratio` CSS to eliminate CLS issues
- added a low quality poster image to show visual progress before the
  video is finished loading and improve LCP
