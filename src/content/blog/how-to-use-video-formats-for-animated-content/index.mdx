Despite the popularity of animated GIFs on the web, they're often
humongous in file size and slow to load. Because of this, Lighthouse
and [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) audits will flag
any animated GIF that's
[over 100 KiB](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/f33cf9375583c384efa4379d55df1f1936406d2b/core/audits/byte-efficiency/efficient-animated-content.js#L63)
with the warning message "**Use video formats for animated content**."

import psi from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-fail-animated-gif.png";

<Image

  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>

What's the solution?

1. **Replace all animated GIFs with optimized videos**.
2. **Never use GIFs again**.

In this post, I'll show you how to cut the size of a **2.5 MB GIF**
down to a **69 KB video** while also improving load and
[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) times.

## Why does this matter?

Animated GIFs are usually
[much bigger](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/4696#issuecomment-370979920)
than videos, which can result in the following:

- Longer load times
- Less bandwidth to download other assets on the page
- More cellular data that mobile users pay for
- Slower LCP

How do you fix this? Let's run through an example.

## Step 1: Measure the baseline GIF

Let's start with an animated GIF from
[this demo page](/demos/use-video-instead-of-gif-before/). It has a
Homer Simpson animated GIF above the fold. There's nothing else that
captures embarrassment and awkwardness in one easy-to-use image.
What's not to love?

Unfortunately, PageSpeed Insights doesn't find it amusing.

import animatedGifBaseline from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-animated-gif-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={animatedGifBaseline}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a 75 performance score, 14.2 second Largest Contentful Paint, and a `Use video formats for animated content` warning."
/>

Let's see how it fares using
[WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) using the following
settings:

- **Test Location**: Virginia, EC2
- **Browser**: Chrome on emulated Motorola G (gen 4)
- **Connection**: 4G (9 Mbps, 170ms RTT)
- **Number of Tests to Run**: 9

import webPageTestBaseline from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaseline}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 3.646 LCP."
/>

import webPageTestBaselineWaterfall from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline-waterfall.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaselineWaterfall}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 2.7 second load time for the animated GIF."
  caption="The animated GIF takes 2.7 seconds to load."
/>

The
[baseline results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230826_AiDc13_9FX/)
show:

- **LCP**: 1.3 seconds\*
- **Page Weight**: 2,442 KB
- **Load time**: 3.616 seconds

<Aside heading="*LCP for autoplaying video or animated GIF">
  As of [August
  2023](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered), the first
  frame of an autoplaying video or animated GIF can be the LCP
  element. But WebPageTest erroneously reports the LCP as 3.646
  seconds for these results. Presumably, this is because it's using an
  older definition.
</Aside>

## Step 2: Convert to MP4 and WebM video formats

Next, let's convert the animated GIF to video. But which format should
you pick? MP4 has the best browser support, but WebM results in
smaller file sizes and less support.

| Format | Browser support                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| MP4    | > 96.2% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mpeg4)) |
| WebM   | > 95.8% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webm))  |

You'll need to decide whether only serving WebM offers enough browser
support for your audience. Or you can offer both options and let the
browser decide — that's the approach this article will take.

### Option 1: Use FFmpeg

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a popular command-line tool for
converting video. To convert the GIF to MP4, use the following
command:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -vf "crop=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" -b:v 0 -crf 25 -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p homer-simpson.mp4
```

And to convert to WebM:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 homer-simpson.webm
```

The preceding commands decrease the file size by 95% for MP4 and by
97% for WebM.

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 122 KB   | 80 KB     |

If you only have a few videos on your site, you can get great results
by manually converting GIFs with the preceding commands. But I
recommend using automation for anything more than that.

### Option 2: Use an image CDN

Because video and
[image optimization](/blog/how-to-efficiently-encode-images/) can be a
pain at scale, I prefer to delegate these responsibilities to an image
CDN service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Although image
CDNs are typically not free, they can save a lot of hassle with media
management and produce great results.

After uploading the image to Cloudinary, you can dynamically convert
it to MP4 by replacing the `.gif` file extension with `.mp4`:

```text
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.mp4
```

Similarly, use the `.webm` extension in the URL to convert to WebM:

```text
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.webm
```

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 88 KB    | 71 KB     |

By converting the GIF to video with Cloudinary, the file size reduced
by **96%** when converted to MP4 and by over **97%** when converted to
WebM.

## Step 3: Replace the `img` element with a `video` element

Instead of using the `<img>` element to serve a GIF, replace it with
the `<video>` element, which can serve different formats via the
[source element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source).

```html
<video>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

The `source` elements allow the browser to serve the WebM format if it
supports it. If it doesn't, it will fall back to MP4.

<Aside heading="Order matters">
It's essential to put the lightest format **on top** as the browser
will use the first supported format starting from the top. Placing the
MP4 `<source>` element on top of the WebM would undesirably cause
browsers that support both formats to use MP4.
</Aside>

GIF offers the ability to autoplay, loop, and play silently, which you
can replicate with the `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` attributes for
video:

```html {/autoplay loop muted/}
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width: 100%">
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

The `style` attribute expands the video to the width of the content,
while the `playsinline` attribute is needed on iOS to prevent the
video from entering fullscreen mode.

After doing this, the video looks nearly identical to the original
GIF, but with one jarring problem — after the video loads, it shifts
the text down, resulting in a
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS):

import CLS from "./_assets/cumulative-layout-shift-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video results in a large Cumulative Layout Shift"
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLS]}
  caption="The text moves down after the video loads, resulting in a large Cumulative Layout Shift."
/>

The browser doesn't know the video's aspect ratio until after it has
loaded, which causes the layout shift. What can you do about this?

## Step 4: Add aspect-ratio CSS

Unlike the `<img>` element, you can't add `width` and `height`
attributes to the video to let the browser figure out the aspect
ratio. That should work, but it's
[broken](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7524). To get
around this, you can use the
[`aspect-ratio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio)
CSS property instead.

```html {6}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

With the `aspect-ratio` CSS, the browser knows how much space to
allocate for the video before it has even been started downloading. As
a result, you've eliminated the layout shift.

import CLSFix from "./_assets/fix-cls-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video with aspect-ratio CSS prevents CLS."
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLSFix]}
  caption="Using `aspect-ratio` CSS prevents a Cumulative Layout Shift after the video loads."
/>

Okay, now you have an optimized video that serves different formats
based on browser support and doesn't cause a Cumulative Layout Shift
after it loads. Let's examine the WebPageTest waterfall chart at this
point.

import WPTTimelineVideo from "./_assets/web-page-test-timeline-video.png";

<Image
  src={WPTTimelineVideo}
  alt="WebPageTest waterfall showing the first frame of the video appearing after the video has loaded."
/>

This waterfall shows that the video's first frame only appears after
the entire video finishes downloading. Ideally, that should render as
quickly as possible to indicate visual progress. This also affects the
LCP since it's the
[first frame of an autoplaying video](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered).

Luckily, there's another trick you can use for this.

## Step 5: Add a poster image

Using the
[`poster` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)
with a small image, you can encourage the browser to paint the first
frame faster. That instructs the browser to download and display an
image while the video is loading.

Given that this image will only show initially, you should apply heavy
compression to it so that it downloads as quickly as possible. Shoot
for an image file size that's less than 5 KB. Remember, its only
purpose is to indicate visual progress, so it's okay if the quality is
low.

Using FFMpeg, you can use the following command to extract the first
frame of the video as an image.

```shell
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -ss 0 -qscale:v 31 -frames:v 1 poster.jpg
```

If the quality is too low, raise it by lowering the `qscale:v` param
(1 is the highest quality, 31 is the lowest quality).

You can also use Cloudinary to get the first frame of the GIF by
replacing the `.gif` file extension with `.jpg` in the URL. To lower
the quality and reduce the image's file size, add `q_10` to the path.

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/q_10/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.jpg
```

Next, add the image to the poster attribute:

```html {7}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
  poster="/poster.jpg"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

Now WebPageTest shows the first frame rendering about **100ms
earlier** for most runs:

import WPTPoster from "./_assets/web-page-test-poster-timeline.png";

<Image
  src={WPTPoster}
  alt="WebPageTest waterfall that shows the first frame of the video rendering after the poster image has loaded and before the video has finished loading."
/>

## Step 6: Measure the impact

Let's test the
[page with the video](/demos/use-video-instead-of-gif-after/) and
compare it to the
[page with the GIF](/demos/use-video-instead-of-gif-before/).

Testing the video with PageSpeed Insights results in a perfect score.
That's a 25-point improvement over the page that used a GIF.

import PSIResults from "./_assets/psi-results.png";

<Image
  src={PSIResults}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a perfect score when testing the video."
/>

When comparing the GIF and video results from WebPageTest, you can see
the following improvements:

- **97% decrease** in **file size** (2,392 KB GIF down to 69 KB video
  with 5 KB poster)
- **95% decrease** in **page weight** (2,442 KB down to 122 KB)
- **100 ms improvement** in **LCP**
- **65% decrease** in **page load time** (3.616 seconds down to 1.247
  seconds)

import WPTFimstripResults from "./_assets/web-page-test-results-filmstrip.png";

<Image
  src={WPTFimstripResults}
  alt="WebPageTest filmstrip showing the first frame of the video rendering earlier than the first frame of the GIF."
  caption="WebPageTest showing a 100 ms improvement in LCP."
/>

## Conclusion

Replacing animated GIFs with optimized videos can improve several
aspects of your website's performance, including load time, LCP and
page weight.
