Despite the popularity of animated GIFs on the web, they're often
humongous in file size and slow to load. Because of this, Lighthouse
and [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) audits will flag
any animated GIF that is
[over 100 KiB](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/f33cf9375583c384efa4379d55df1f1936406d2b/core/audits/byte-efficiency/efficient-animated-content.js#L63)
with the warning message "**Use video formats for animated content**".

import psi from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-fail-animated-gif.png";

<Image
  src={psi}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a failing `Use video formats for animated content` audit."
  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>

What's the solution?

1. Replace all animated GIFs with optimized videos
2. Never use GIFs again

In this post, I'll show you how I cut the size of a **2.5 MB GIF**
down to a **80 KB video** (97% decrease) while also improving load and
Largest Contentful Paint times.

## Why does this matter?

Animated GIFs are usually
[much bigger](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/4696#issuecomment-370979920)
than videos which results in:

- Longer load times
- Less bandwidth available to download other assets on the page
- More cellular data that mobile users pay for
- Slower [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) times
  (when used above the fold)

How do we fix this? Let's run through an example.

## Step 1: Measure baseline GIF

We'll start with an animated GIF from
[this demo page](/demos/use-video-instead-of-gif-before/). In the
demo, I've used a Homer Simpson animated GIF above the fold. There's
nothing else that captures embarrassment and awkwardness into one
easy-to-use image. What's not to love?

Unfortunately, PageSpeed Insights doesn't find it amusing.

import animatedGifBaseline from "./_assets/page-speed-insights-animated-gif-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={animatedGifBaseline}
  alt="PageSpeed Insights report showing a 75 performance score, 14.2 second Largest Contentful Paint, and a `Use video formats for animated content` warning."
/>

Let's see how it fares using
[WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/). I'll use the following
settings:

- **Test Location**: Virginia, EC2
- **Browser**: Chrome on emulated Motorola G (gen 4)
- **Connection**: 4G (9 Mbps, 170ms RTT)
- **Number of Test to Run**: 9

The
[results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230825_AiDcCZ_9GD/?test=230825_AiDcCZ_9GD&medianMetric=chromeUserTiming.LargestContentfulPaint)
show a slow LCP and long load time:

- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 3.646 seconds
- **Page Weight**: 2,442 KB
- **Load time**: 3.643 seconds

import webPageTestBaseline from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaseline}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 3.646 Largest Contentful Paint"
/>

import webPageTestBaselineWaterfall from "./_assets/web-page-test-baseline-waterfall.png";

<Image
  src={webPageTestBaselineWaterfall}
  alt="WebPageTest baseline showing 2.7 second load time for the animated GIF"
  caption="The animated GIF loaded in 2.7 seconds"
/>

## Step 2: Convert to MP4 and WebM video formats

We need to convert the animated GIF to video. But which format should
we use? MP4 has the best browser support, but WebM results in smaller
file sizes with less support.

| Format | Browser support                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| MP4    | > 96.2% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mpeg4)) |
| WebM   | > 95.8% (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webm))  |

You'll need to decide whether solely using WebM offers enough browser
support for your use case. Or you can offer both options and let the
browser decide — that's the approach we'll take in this example.

### Option 1: Use FFmpeg

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a popular command-line tool for
converting video. We can use the following command to convert to MP4:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -vf "crop=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" -b:v 0 -crf 25 -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p homer-simpson.mp4
```

And use this command to convert to WebM:

```sh
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 homer-simpson.webm
```

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 122 KB   | 80 KB     |

By converting the GIF to video with FFMpeg, we reduced the file size
by **95%** when converted to MP4 and by **97%** when converted to
WebM.

If you only have a few videos on your site, you can get great results
just by manually converting GIFs with the preceeding commands. But I
recommend using automation for anything more than that.

### Option 2: Use an image CDN

Because video and
[image](/blog/how-to-efficiently-encode-images/#option-3-use-an-image-cdn-to-handle-everything)
optimization can be a pain at scale, I like to delegate these
responsibilities to an image CDN service like
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Although image CDNs are
typically not free, they can save a lot of hassle with media
management and produce great results.

After uploading the image to Cloudinary, you can dynamically convert
it to MP4 by replacing the `.gif` file extension with `.mp4`:

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.mp4
```

Similarly, use the `.webm` extension in the url to convert to WebM:

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.webm
```

| GIF (KB) | MP4 (KB) | WebM (KB) |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2.5 MB   | 88 KB    | 71 KB     |

By converting the GIF to video with Cloudinary, we reduced the file
size by **96%** when converted to MP4 and by over **97%** when
converted to WebM.

## Step 3: Replace `img` element with `video` element

Instead of using the `<img>` element to serve a GIF, we'll use the
`<video>` element which supports different formats using the
[source element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source):

```html
<video>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

By using two `source` elements, we allow the browser to use the WebM
format if it supports it and fallback to MP4 if it doesn't.

import { Aside } from "@components/Aside/index.astro";

<Aside heading="Order matters">

It's important to put the lightest format **on top** as the browser
will use the first supported format (from top to bottom). Placing the
MP4 `<source>` element on top of the WebM would undesirably cause
browsers that support both formats to use MP4.

</Aside>

GIF offers the ability to autoplay, loop, and play silently which we
can replicate with the `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` attributes for
video:

```html {/autoplay loop muted/}
<video autoplay loop muted style="width: 100%">
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

I also added the `style` attribute to let the video expand to the
width of the content.

After doing this, our video looks nearly identical to the original
GIF, but with one jarring problem — after the video loads, it shifts
the text down, resulting in a
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS):

import CLS from "./_assets/cumulative-layout-shift-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video results in a large Cumulative Layout Shift"
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLS]}
  caption="The text moves down after the video loads, resulting in a large Cumulative Layout Shift."
/>

The browser doesn't know the aspect ratio of the video until after
it's loaded and that's what causes the layout shift. What can we do
about this?

## Step 4: Add aspect-ratio CSS

Unlike the `<img>`, we can't just add `width` and `height` attributes
to the video to let the browser figure out the aspect ratio. Actually,
this is supposed to work, but it's
[currently broken](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7524).
To get around this, we can use the
[`aspect-ratio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio)
CSS property instead.

```html {5}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

With the `aspect-ratio` CSS, the browser knows how much space to
allocate for the video before it has even downloaded. As a result,
we've eliminated the shift.

import CLSFix from "./_assets/fix-cls-video.mp4";

<Video
  description="Loading the demo page that has a video with aspect-ratio CSS prevents CLS."
  width="1368"
  height="1080"
  src={[CLSFix]}
  caption="Using `aspect-ratio` CSS prevents a Cumulative Layout Shift after the video loads."
/>

Okay, now we have a video that is a tiny file size, serves different
formats based on browser support, and doesn't cause a Cumulative
Layout Shift after it loads. Let's examine the WebPageTest timeline at
this point.

import WPTTimelineVideo from "./_assets/web-page-test-timeline-video.png";

<Image
  src={WPTTimelineVideo}
  alt="WebPageTest timeline showing the first frame of the video doesn't render until after the video has been loaded."
/>

Many of the timelines showed that the video's first frame didn't paint
until the entire video had finished downloading. Ideally, we want that
to render as quickly as possible to indicate visual progress. As of
[August 2023](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered), this
also affects the Largest Contentful Paint time since its the first
frame of an autoplaying video. Luckily, there's another trick we can
use for this.

## Step 5: Add poster attribute

We can try to make the first frame render faster by using the
[`poster` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)
which tells the browser to download and display an image while the
video is loading.

Using FFMpeg, you can use the following command to extract the first
frame of the video as an image.

```shell
ffmpeg -i homer-simpson.gif -ss 00:00:00 -frames:v 1 poster.jpg
```

And using Cloudinary, you can just set the file extension as a `jpg`
and decrease the file size by adding the `q_10` to the path which
decreases the quality of the image.

```url
https://res.cloudinary.com/nray/image/upload/q_10/homer-simpson_hkeb1w.jpg
```

Given that this image will only show initially, we should apply heavy
compression to it so that it downloads as quickly as possible.
Remember, its only purpose is to indicate visual progress so its okay
if the quality is on the low side. The poster image I've generated
results in a

Next, add the poster attribute using the new image.

```html {6}
<video
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 480 / 354"
  poster="/poster.jpg"
>
  <source src="/homer-simpson.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/homer-simpson.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

## Step 6: Measure impact
