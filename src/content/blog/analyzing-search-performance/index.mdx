Wikipedia's desktop site is getting an
[updated look](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements/Features/Search)
for the first time in over a decade, and that new experience will feature a
search component. As part of a
[case study](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180) for adopting a modern
Javascript framework in MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia, we
developed the new typeahead search component using the Vue.js framework. One of
our goals for this project was to improve the search experience from the old
legacy search component by including more contextual information such as article
descriptions and thumbnails in the search suggestion results.

<Image

  alt="Wikipedia's legacy search component which shows a textual list of suggestions without thumbnails"
  caption="The legacy search component. The suggestions only include the
  titles of articles. Helpful contextual info like 
  thumbnails and descriptions are not included."
/>

Since users across the world visit Wikipedia using a wide range of internet
connection speeds and device specs, our team puts a premium on performance and
we generally try to avoid loading anything but essential scripts and styles on
the
[critical rendering path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path).
To do this, the legacy search component loads most of its resources (JS, CSS,
i18n messages) "lazily" and defers downloading the resources until the user
first focuses the input. Once loaded, the search component shows suggestions
based on what the user has typed in the input. This kind of lazy loading
strategy is commonly seen on mobile sites that defer loading images until they
enter the viewport. For the new search component, we chose to follow suit and
also load the new search component when the user first focuses the input.
However, we knew, regardless of the loading strategy used, that comparing the
performance of the legacy search component with the performance of the new Vue
search component would be important.

## Implementing synthetic performance tests

There are two types of performance metrics that we collect at Wikipedia. One
method involves collecting metrics from real users (commonly referred to as
"real user monitoring"). Another method is to use
[synthetic performance tests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic#synthetic_monitoring)
which are automated scripts that run in a controlled environment and simulate
user behavior. During the course of this project, one of my responsibilities was
to implement synthetic performance instrumentation that would help us compare
the performance of the legacy search component with the Vue search component and
also facilitate detecting performance regressions in both legacy and Vue search
implementations. The synthetic test would collect performance metrics related to
loading the search experience and the list of suggestions that appear after
typing characters into the input.

<Image

  alt="Phabricator ticket T251544 which is titled 'Add user journey performance tests for Vector Legacy and Vue.js search'"
  caption="T251544: The ticket I worked on to implement synthetic performance
  tests for both Vue and legacy search."
/>

## Metric definitions

Although there are multiple ways to measure the performance of the search
experience, I was interested in measuring several specific aspects:

### Metric 1: Search Load Start To Load End

The time it takes to lazy load and execute the search resources (e.g. JS, CSS,
i18n message) when the input is focused. At Wikipedia, we package the related
resources together in JS and refer to that package as a "module". Multiple
modules are required for both the legacy and Vue search experiences.

<Image
  src={barsSearchLoadStartToLoadEnd}
  alt="The steps involved in the 'Search load start to load end' metric including typing the letter 'a' into the input, JS loading search, network request, and modules initializing."
/>

### Metric 2: Search Load Start To First Render

The time it takes from the start of lazy loading the search modules to the point
at which the first set of search suggestions are shown to the user.

<Image
  src={barsLoadStartToFirstRender}
  alt="The steps involved in the 'Search load start to load end' metric including typing the letter 'a' into the input, JS loading search, network request, modules initializing, JS initiating request for letter 'a', network request, js mutating DOM with suggestions, suggestions visible to user."
/>

### Metric 3: Search Query To Render

The time it takes to fetch and show each set of search suggestions using three
different queries (‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúab‚Äù, ‚Äúabc‚Äù). The graphic below depicts the set of steps
for the query "a".

<Image
  src={barsQueryToRender}
  alt="The steps involved in the 'Search load start to load end' metric including JS initiating request for 'a', network request, JS mutating DOM with suggestions, and suggestions visible to user."
/>

### All the steps that happen in the synthetic test

A single synthetic test collects one "Search Load Start To Load End" metric, one
"Search Load Start To First Render" metric, and three "Search Query To Render"
metrics as depicted below.

<Image src={barsAllMetrics} alt="All the metrics combined" />

**Disclaimer**: In practice, the synthetic tests were a little more complex than
depicted above. After typing the character "a" in the input and waiting for the
suggestions to appear, the test would type "bc", wait for the suggestions, and
then backspace and wait for the suggestions to appear for the query "ab".
However, the net effect was that the queries "a", "ab", "abc" were still tested
and, for simplicity, that is what is depicted.

## Synthetic Test Results

Towards the end of March 2021, I took a screenshot of the dashboard containing
the synthetic test results that had been collected to that point. The results
showed our Vue search implementation performing **worse** in each metric by a
factor of ~1.7. üò±

<Image
  src={dashboard}
  alt="Dashboard showing `Search Load Start to Load End`, `Search Load Start to First Render`, and `Search query`."
  caption="A screenshot of the synthetic
test dashboard taken toward the end of March 2021. The results show Vue search
slower by ~1.7x in each metric."
/>

## Important factors to consider

Before getting too discouraged by these results, it's important to keep the
following things in mind:

- Vue search and legacy search use different APIs (see
  ["Query to Render" metric investigation ](#search-query-to-render-network-request)
  for more on this). Additionally, the API that Vue search uses needs to fetch
  thumbnails and descriptions, while the legacy search API does not have this
  requirement.
- The synthetic tests are scripts and therefore exhibit artificial behavior.
  They are **not real users**. Testing real users may yield **different**
  results.
- The tests run with an **empty browser cache**. Of course, most users will have
  cache enabled so the differences represented in these results represent the
  worst-case scenario.
- The biggest differences we see in the results are **several hundred
  milliseconds**.
- The tests run from AWS instances from **North Virginia** and they tested
  **[French Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org)** using the Barack Obama page.
- The internet connection speed is intentionally **throttled** to simulate
  **poor internet connections**.
- Each synthetic test performs 5 runs every ~4 hours and the **median** for each
  metric is used.
- Only **three** queries are tested (‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúab‚Äù, ‚Äúabc‚Äù). Other queries in the
  wild may deviate from these results.

At the surface, these results are disappointing but perhaps not surprising given
the points above. However, I was unsatisfied with their ambiguity. While these
graphs show Vue search performing worse in each metric, they don't convey
**which** steps are worse in each metric. I wanted to know more. Therefore, I
investigated deeper to find out **where this time was spent**.

## Let's look at the timelines

Fortunately, our dashboard allows one to download and view the actual
performance timelines that were recorded during each test. Given this ability, I
imported each timeline into my Chrome browser and investigated the last 7 days
of performance timelines that the synthetic tests had collected.

### Search Load Start To Load End Investigation

#### Search Load Start To Load End: Network Request

As part of this metric, three steps could potentially be slow. Given that the
"JS to load search executes" is relatively fast, let's first focus on the
"Network Request" step.

<Image
  src={networkSearchLoadStartToLoadEnd}
  alt="Search load start to load end with network request focused"
/>

| Test                       | Search Load Start To Load End | Network Request |

| legacy-2021-03-27 9:40:00  | 274.04 ms                     | 112.89 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-27 10:10:00    | 565.24 ms                     | 217.86 ms       |

| legacy-2021-03-24 22:50:00 | 285.71 ms                     | 113.76 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-24 23:10:00    | 526.49 ms                     | 217.87 ms       |
| legacy-2021-03-24 01:30:00 | 306.10 ms                     | 113.10 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-24 01:50:00    | 564.24 ms                     | 217.99 ms       |
| legacy-2021-03-22 23:50:00 | 294.11 ms                     | 113.25 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-23 00:10:00    | 535.96 ms                     | 217.67 ms       |
| legacy-2021-03-21 22:30:00 | 287.76 ms                     | 112.85 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-21 23:00:00    | 515.66 ms                     | 217.73 ms       |
| legacy-2021-03-21 01:30:00 | 273.39 ms                     | 112.92 ms       |
| vue-2021-03-21 01:50:00    | 500.94 ms                     | 217.92 ms       |

As can be seen from the table above, the network request to load Vue search
modules is taking ~1.9x as long to complete. When I examined legacy and Vue's
respective network requests, I found significant differences in the payload size
of the response containing their relevant modules. The **69.6 kB** payload size
to lazy load Vue search dwarfs the **6.9** kB payload size to load legacy
search. Legacy search depends on jQuery but since that library is loaded when
the page loads on Wikipedia, it does not influence this step. However, the
Vue.js library _is_ loaded during the lazy load of Vue search. This helps
explain the performance differences observed in the table.

  alt="A comparison between the legacy search payload and the new search payload."

#### Search Load Start To Load End: Modules initialize

Next, we'll look at the "Modules initialize" step where the JS that was
downloaded as part of the "Network Request" step gets executed.

  alt="Search load start to load end with module initialization focused"

| Test                       | Search Load Start To Load End | Modules Initialize |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| legacy-2021-03-27 9:40:00  | 274.04 ms                     | 7.48 ms            |
| vue-2021-03-27 10:10:00    | 565.24 ms                     | 209.61 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-26 00:10:00 | 283.21 ms                     | 7.48 ms            |
| vue-2021-03-26 00:30:00    | 521.03 ms                     | 204.38 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-24 22:50:00 | 285.71 ms                     | 7.29 ms            |
| vue-2021-03-24 23:10:00    | 526.49 ms                     | 207.45 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-24 01:30:00 | 306.10 ms                     | 10.95 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-24 01:50:00    | 564.24 ms                     | 187.19 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-22 23:50:00 | 294.11 ms                     | 10.62 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-23 00:10:00    | 535.96 ms                     | 211.23 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-21 22:30:00 | 287.76 ms                     | 13.19 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-21 23:00:00    | 515.66 ms                     | 211.72 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-21 01:30:00 | 273.39 ms                     | 9.04 ms            |
| vue-2021-03-21 01:50:00    | 500.94 ms                     | 191.82 ms          |

Notice from the table above that the time it takes to initialize Vue search
modules takes roughly ~20x as long. The relatively large execution time for Vue
search is somewhat intuitive given that it uses a reactive framework with a
larger footprint than legacy search.

**Disclaimer**: The timeline bars I observed for this data were fairly ambiguous
for Vue search. The data above reflects my best guess as to what was happening,
but there is a possibility that it is not accurate.

#### Search Query To Render: Network Request

<Image
  src={networkSearchQueryToRender}
  alt="Search query to render with network request focused"
/>

Since there are three "Search Query To Render" metrics collected during a test
(for the queries "a", "ab", "abc"), let's looks at the time it took for each
network request.

| Test                       | Network Request #1 | Network Request #2 | Network Request #3 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| legacy-2021-03-27 9:40:00  | 34.78 ms           | 33.53 ms           | 33.67 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-27 10:10:00    | 34.74 ms           | 37.97 ms           | 105.01 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-26 00:10:00 | 34.68 ms           | 33.70 ms           | 33.55 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-26 00:30:00    | 34.77 ms           | 104.25 ms          | 108.77 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-24 22:50:00 | 34.82 ms           | 33.59 ms           | 33.59 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-24 23:10:00    | 34.99 ms           | 93.08 ms           | 114.89 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-24 01:30:00 | 35.31 ms           | 33.61 ms           | 33.48 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-24 01:50:00    | 34.46 ms           | 100.22 ms          | 72.55 ms           |
| legacy-2021-03-22 23:50:00 | 34.40 ms           | 33.51 ms           | 33.57 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-23 00:10:00    | 34.58 ms           | 110.39 ms          | 138.15 ms          |
| legacy-2021-03-21 22:30:00 | 34.90 ms           | 34.05 ms           | 33.46 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-21 23:00:00    | 34.83 ms           | 105.89 ms          | 91.70 ms           |
| legacy-2021-03-21 01:30:00 | 34.98 ms           | 33.92 ms           | 33.47 ms           |
| vue-2021-03-21 01:50:00    | 34.49 ms           | 34.28 ms           | 109.56 ms          |

The table shows that the time it takes the legacy search ajax request to
complete is more consistent than Vue search. The Vue search network request is
more variable and sometimes 3x-4x slower than legacy search.

These results were a little peculiar to me. Vue search uses a different
API/endpoint (our [REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API)) than
legacy search (which uses our
[Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)), and Vue search was
the default search experience for anonymous users (the majority of Wikipedia's
userbase) on French Wikipedia. Since the respective API for legacy search and
Vue search takes advantage of our
[edge front-end caching infrastructure](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Caching_overview),
I'd think our caching infrastructure for Vue search would have been more primed
than legacy search and would have shown more consistency. Unfortunately,
determining whether the response came from the edge or not was not available
info in the timelines I downloaded. I hypothesize that the < 50 ms requests in
this table are coming from the edge cache, but oddly enough there is a higher
percentage of _legacy_ requests in this category.

Another factor that might be playing a role here is that the Vue search API has
to fetch **more data** than legacy search. The Vue search needs that that
includes article titles, thumbnails, and descriptions whereas legacy search only
needs to fetch article titles. The extra work that the Vue search API must do to
produce a response might help explain why the Vue search request can sometimes
take longer than the legacy search request. The instances where the request time
is the same might be explained by the response coming from the edge cache.

The tables show legacy search JS execution time (after the network request) is
often 2x-4x that of Vue search. Out of all the steps I analyzed, this was one of
the most interesting to me. Why would Vue search which uses Vue.js and has the
[overhead of a virtual DOM](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)
be _faster_ than legacy search which has no such overhead and uses imperative
jQuery DOM manipulations?

To answer this question, I investigated a performance timeline from legacy
search and found that legacy search had a series of purple "recalc style" and
"layout" bars. One pair of these bars is referred to as a
[forced synchronous layout](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_forced_synchronous_layouts)
and can be a potential source of inefficiency. However, when those bars repeat
in succession like depicted below, it is commonly referred to as "layout
thrashing" and is an even bigger bottleneck. Taking this into account, it became
much easier to see why Vue search made up some ground and performed better than
legacy search for this step.

#### Search Load Start To First Render: Is there more?

  step and the initiation of the ajax request"
/>

Since the "Search load start to first render" metric is a superset of the
"search load start to load end" metric and the first "search query to render"
metric, we'd expect that all the factors that led to Vue performing worse in the
previous metrics would play a role in this metric. This is true, but it turns
out that there is an additional factor to consider between the "modules
initialize" step and the "JS initiates request for 'a'" step.

While both search implementations use a debouncer to prevent excessive network
requests when the user rapidly types (or holds down a key), the legacy search
implementation fires a network request during the module initialization step if
it detects characters in the input while the Vue search implementation
debounces/delays the request when this same scenario is recognized. While this
should be easily correctable, it certainly plays a role in this metric as Vue
search was using a 200ms debounce time when these results were recorded.

## Conclusion

From my analysis, I believe the following to be true at the time of this
writing:

- Vue search‚Äôs JS modules are slower to load than legacy search‚Äôs modules. This
  is likely because of a 10x increase (6.9 kB vs 69 kB) in payload size.
- Vue search‚Äôs JS modules are slower to initialize than legacy search‚Äôs modules.
- Vue search's JS handling of each ajax response is faster than legacy search.
  This is likely due to legacy search‚Äôs inefficient layout thrashing.
- All of the metrics collected are influenced by network requests including
  whether they have been cached by the edge (e.g. Varnish).
- The legacy search API usually has a faster network response for the queries
  ‚Äúab‚Äù and ‚Äúabc‚Äù, but both have similar speeds for the query ‚Äúa‚Äù. This might be
  related to the fact that the Vue search API must do more work than legacy
  search API to produce a response by needing to include thumbnails and
  descriptions.
- Vue search is influenced by debounce time during the "Search Load Start To
  First Render" metric. Legacy search fires the request immediately if the input
  while the search modules are loading. We should be able to easily improve Vue
  search in this regard.

During this analysis, I looked at many performance timelines and data. You can
take a closer look at the same data I observed by importing the timelines I
[saved in a repo](https://github.com/nicholasray/search-performance-data/tree/master/profiles).
