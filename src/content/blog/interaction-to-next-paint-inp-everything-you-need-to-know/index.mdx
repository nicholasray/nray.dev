**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** will become the next **Core Web Vital** on
**March 2024**, replacing **First Input Delay (FID)** as the metric that
measures how quickly a page responds to user interactions. Currently, **35.1% of
mobile websites** fall short of Google's latest web performance standard.

**90% of a user's time** on a webpage happens after it loads. Users expect that
when they interact with a page by clicking a button, tapping a menu item, or
pressing a key, visual feedback happens — **and occurs quickly**. INP captures
this latency and flags interactions that are slow enough to cause a **negative
user experience**.

Fast interactions are essential for **user happiness** and **business success**:

- [Rage clicking is one side effect of poor INP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Euu4FBL75z0I8UtKf3dTzrLYu6wxfeWnrmXUCn9AQIY/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-t6sEnmSbzYTO_fcrR8n9Jg)
- [redBus increased sales by 7% after improving their INP](https://web.dev/redbus-inp/)
- [The Economic Times decreased bounce rate by 50% and increased pageviews by 43% by reducing INP nearly 4x](https://web.dev/economic-times-inp/)

In this article, you will learn about INP and how to optimize it for your
website to provide your users with smooth interactions.

## What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

INP is a metric that evaluates how quickly a page visually responds to specific
user interactions.

import inpTimeline from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-timeline.svg";
import inpTimelineDark from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-timeline-dark.svg";

<Image
  src={inpTimeline}
  dark={inpTimelineDark}
  alt="Timeline measuring interaction latency beginning at a click, tap, or key press and ending at a visual update."
/>

For example, when you:

- Click a menu button, INP measures how long it takes for the menu to appear.
- Tap the close button of a modal, INP measures how long it takes for the modal
  to disappear
- Type something into an input field, INP measures how long it takes for that
  character to appear in the field

import INPScale from "./_components/INPScale.astro";

<INPScale></INPScale>

As a Core Web Vital, INP measures a critical aspect of a user's experience —
**interactivity** and **responsiveness**. Google will use INP as a
[**page experience signal**](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience)
that influences your website's search ranking.

import inpSearchRanking from "./_assets/inp-search-ranking.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpSearchRanking}
  alt={`Google Search Central website highlighting that "Google's core ranking systems look to reward content that provides a good page experience" and highlighting a bullet under a "Self-assess your content's page experience" that asks "Do pages have good Core Web Vitals?".`}
  caption="Google suggests that Core Web Vitals, which INP will become on March 2024, is a page experience signal that influences search ranking."
/>

## What is the difference between First Input Delay (FID) and INP?

The INP metric is FID's successor, replacing it as a Core Web Vital on
March 2024. Although both metrics measure a page's interactivity and
responsiveness, INP provides a more thorough assessment of a user's experience
on a page compared to FID by:

- Observing _all_ interactions throughout the lifetime of a page instead of only
  the first interaction
- Measuring the time it takes from the start of the interaction to the moment
  the first frame appears instead of only measuring the time it takes for the
  browser to be able to respond to the interaction (input delay portion)

import inpFid from "./_assets/inp-vs-fid.svg";
import inpFidDark from "./_assets/inp-vs-fid-dark.svg";

<Image
  src={inpFid}
  dark={inpFidDark}
  alt="An interaction timeline consisting of input delay, processing time, and presentation delay portions. First Input Delay only measures the input delay portion. In contrast, Interaction to Next Paint measures all the portions of an interaction."
  caption="FID only measures the input delay portion of an interaction. In contrast, INP measures all three components."
/>

Part of the reason why websites rarely had poor FID scores was because it only
measured the **input delay** portion of the user's first interaction. Because
INP measurement includes the moment a visual change occurs, it's a better
indicator of user experience.

Websites have worse INP scores compared to FID, particularly on mobile devices.
As of May 2023,
[99.9% of desktop sites and 93.2% of mobile sites passed FID](https://httparchive.org/reports/chrome-ux-report#cruxFastFid),
compared to
[96.6% of desktop sites and just **64.9%** of mobile sites passing INP](https://httparchive.org/reports/chrome-ux-report#cruxFastInp).

## How is INP Measured?

During a user's visit to a web page, INP measures the time elapsed between every
click, tap, and keypress until a visual change occurs. This elapsed time
represents the **interaction's latency**. When the user leaves the page, the INP
score is calculated based on one of the recorded interaction latencies.

import inpSpinner from "./_assets/inp-progress-indicator.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpSpinner}
  alt="An interaction timeline showing the latency between a click, tap, or key press and a visual update consisting of a spinner."
  caption="INP only cares about the first frame after an interaction, which can include intermediate visual states like a spinner."
/>

Most of the time, INP is equal to the page's **longest interaction latency**.
There's an exception, however, when a user performs **50 or more** interactions
on a page (as can often happen with single-page applications). In this case, INP
will ignore **one interaction for every 50 interactions** in an effort to reduce
random outliers. So, for example, when a user views a page:

- If there are **49** interactions, INP will be the slowest interaction
- If there are **50** interactions, INP will be the second slowest interaction
- If there are **99** interactions, INP will _still_ be the second slowest
  interaction
- If there are **100** interactions, INP will be the third slowest interaction
- If there are **149** interactions, INP will _still_ be the third slowest
  interaction
- If there are **150** interactions, INP will be the fourth slowest interaction

As with other Core Web Vitals, the **75th percentile** of _all_ page views is
reported, further reducing noise.

Notably, the visual update doesn't _need_ to be the final visual state. INP is
only concerned with the time it takes to present the next frame after an
interaction. The frame _can_ be an **intermediate state** like a spinner or
progress bar. As long as the interaction results in timely visual feedback that
shows the user _something_ has happened, you can get good INP scores. For the
best user experience, use the
[appropriate progress indicator for the situation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/).

## What's a good INP score?

At the **75th percentile** for any given page and segmented across desktop and
mobile devices:

- INP \<= **200 milliseconds** indicates a page has **good responsiveness**
- INP \<= **500 milliseconds** indicates a page **needs improvement**
- INP \> **500 milliseconds** indicates a page has **poor responsiveness**

import inpScores from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-scores.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpScores}
  alt="Interaction to Next Paint score diagram showing that 0 - 200 ms is good, 201 ms to 500 ms needs improvement, and greater than 500 ms is poor."
/>

## What interactions does INP measure?

INP measures the following interactions:

- **Mouse clicks**
- **Taps on touchscreens**
- **Key presses** (physical and onscreen)

It does NOT measure:

- Hovering
- Scrolling

## What can happen during an interaction?

INP contains **three critical phases**:

1. **Input delay**: Begins when a user clicks, taps, or presses a key and ends
   when the first JavaScript event callback starts executing
2. **Processing time**: The total execution time of the event callbacks
3. **Presentation delay**: Begins when the last event callback completes and
   ends when a visual update occurs

import inpComponents from "./_assets/interaction-to-next-paint-components.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpComponents}
  alt="Detailed interaction timeline consisting of blocking tasks (input delay), event callbacks like pointerup, mouseup, and click (processing time), and render, paint, and composite steps (presentation delay). At the end is a visual update."
  caption="Each interaction consists of an input delay, processing time, and presentation delay. Interaction latency is the sum of these three components."
/>

Each of these phases adds time to the latency of an interaction.

## How to measure INP

Since INP requires interactions with the page, the best way to measure it is
with real users through **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**. Usually, this involves
adding a small piece of JavaScript to your website that tracks the
responsiveness of each interaction on a page (PageSpeed Insights is a notable
exception).

You can use one of the following tools:

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [`web-vitals` JavaScript Library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals)
- [Commerical RUM tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=core+web+vitals+real+user+tools)

### PageSpeed Insights (PSI)

If your site has enough traffic, you may be able to use data from Google's
[Chrome UX Report (CrUX)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/) to get a
rough idea of the interaction latency your users are experiencing. Using CrUX
data can be a convenient option because it doesn't require adding any tracking
script to your website. Instead, Chrome collects this data from
[eligible users](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/#user-eligibility)
and
[eligible pages](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/#eligibility)
automatically.

Google's [PageSpeed Insights (PSI)](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool is one tool
that makes this data easily accessible. Enter a URL and click the **Analyze**
button. Then, look at the "Discover what your real users are experiencing"
section.

import inpPsi from "./_assets/inp-page-speed-insights.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpPsi}
  alt={`Screenshot of PageSpeed Insights report showing a passing Interaction to Next Paint under a "Discover what your real users are experiencing" section`}
  caption="A PageSpeed Insights report can show how real users are experiencing your website."
/>

When using this PageSpeeds Insights, you should be aware of the following:

- The displayed data is aggregated for the
  [most recent 28 days of data](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report/#pagespeed-insights)
- There may be
  [insufficient data](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about#crux)
  for the page you're testing. If there isn't sufficient data for the page
  you've entered, PSI will try to use data from all pages of the origin instead.
  PSI won't show any data if the origin doesn't have enough data.

### `web-vitals` JavaScript Library

Google released an open-source JavaScript library that lets you measure core web
vitals (including INP) from real users. To use it, you'll need to install it
from npm:

```bash
npm install web-vitals
```

Then, import the `attribution` build into your project so that you can get more
details about the interaction:

```js
import { onINP } from "web-vitals/attribution";

function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  // Instead of logging the output as done below, send desired data to an analytics
  // provider.
  console.log(metric);
}

onINP(sendToAnalytics);
```

The above example produces the following output when the page unloads:

import inpWebVitalsResponse from "./_assets/inp-web-vitals-js-example-response.png";

<Image
  src={inpWebVitalsResponse}
  alt={`An expanded JSON object showing "attribution", "entries", "id", "name", "navigationType", "rating", and "value" top-level keys.`}
/>

Importing the `web-vitals/attribution` adds an `attribution.eventEntry` object,
which you can use to derive the `input delay`, `processing time`, and
`presentation delay`:

- `startTime`: Time in milliseconds at which the interaction occurred.
- `processingStart`: Time at which event callbacks started executing. The input
  delay is `processingStart - startTime`.
- `processingEnd`: Time at which event callbacks finished executing. The
  `processing time` duration is `processingEnd - processingStart`.
- `duration`: Total duration of interaction rounded to the nearest 8 ms. The
  `presentation delay` is `startTime + duration - processingEnd`.

You'll want to
[send this](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-an-analytics-endpoint)
and other information contained in the object to your analytics provider.

## What causes slow interactions?

The main reason for slow interactions are **long tasks** — tasks that take
longer than **50 ms** — on the browser's
[**main thread**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread).
These tasks refer to discrete units of work carried out by the browser,
including:

- **HTML parsing**: Convert raw HTML into a DOM tree
- **Style and layout**: Matching elements to selectors, calculating an element's
  computed styles and its geometric properties
- **Painting**: Process of filling in pixels
- **JavaScript**: Work that typically results in visual changes
- **Garbage collection**: Reclaiming memory

Any of these can be responsible for a slow task.

The browser's main thread can only execute one task at a time, and that task
must
[run to completion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop#run-to-completion)
before another task can start. Devices with lower hardware capabilities, such as
mobile phones with slower CPUs, are more likely to have responsiveness issues
because tasks take longer to complete. That's why it's a good idea to test
interactions on devices that resemble the lower-end devices used by most of your
users.

import inpLongTaskSeries from "./_assets/inp-series-of-long-tasks.png";

<Image
  caption="Chrome's performance profiler showing a series of long tasks designated by red diagonal stripes."
  src={inpLongTaskSeries}
  alt="Chrome's performance profiler showing a series of long tasks designated by red diagonal stripes."
/>

**If you have a poor INP score, it's highly likely that long tasks on the main
thread are the primary cause.**

## How to fix INP

Since INP involves [**three phases**](#what-can-happen-during-an-interaction),
each interaction has three opportunities to be slow. Let's examine some of the
most common reasons why **input delay**, **processing time**, and **presentation
delay** can become sluggish and what you can do about it.

## Optimize Input delay

import inpInputDelay from "./_assets/inp-input-delay.png";

<Image
  src={inpInputDelay}
  alt="Interaction timeline highlighting the input delay portion."
  caption="Input delay measures how long it takes the browser to begin executing event callbacks."
/>

The first part of each interaction always involves a small, often unnoticeable,
delay that involves converting the interaction into an event that the browser
understands. Once the browser determines the events associated with an
interaction, it can run any registered event callbacks — unless there is a task
blocking that from happening.

import inpBlockedTask from "./_assets/inp-input-delay-blocked-task.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpBlockedTask}
  alt="Interaction timeline showing a JS task blocking a button click interaction, which contributes to a high input delay."
  caption="Long JS tasks can prevent event callbacks from executing, resulting in a high input delay."
/>

### Long tasks during page startup

The main thread is often the **most congested** when a page loads and
initializes. The browser parses HTML, evaluates scripts, renders, and paints
during this time.

import inpLongTasksStartup from "./_assets/inp-long-tasks-startup.png";

<Image
  src={inpLongTasksStartup}
  alt="Chrome's performance profiler showing many long tasks during page startup."
  caption="The main thread is typically very busy during page startup, which can cause a high input delay."
/>

While there can be a variety of causes for these long tasks, some common
culprits include:

- A single `<script>` tag (without the `type=module` attribute) that loads a
  huge amount of JavaScript. Since each `<script>` kicks off a task that
  evaluates the JavaScript once loaded, it can become problematic if the
  evaluation takes a long time. Instead, first try to reduce the amount of
  JavaScript you are loading. Then, consider having multiple script tags so that
  each one kicks off its own _smaller_ task. Also, consider executing expensive
  logic in a
  [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).
- JavaScript that creates or mutates large DOM trees. Pages with a lot of
  elements can lead to very costly rendering tasks. Instead of using JavaScript
  to mutate the DOM during startup, try to make your server generate the desired
  HTML.

### Rapid interactions

Interactions that occur rapidly, like typing into an autocomplete field, can
cause a high input delay for subsequent interactions.

import inpRapidInteractions from "./_assets/inp-input-delay-rapid-interactions.png";

<Image
  background
  src={inpRapidInteractions}
  alt={`Interaction timeline showing an "A" keypress followed by a "B" keypress resulting in an input delay from the execution of event callbacks related to the "A" keypress.`}
  caption='Interactions that frequently happen, like typing "A" into an input box quickly followed by "B", can cause interaction overlap and a high input delay.'
/>

First, try to reduce the callback's JavaScript logic as much as possible. Then,
to avoid a "death by a thousand cuts" problem that can arise from the
accumulation of multiple small callbacks:

- Debounce input handlers
- Cancel any pending `xhr` or `fetch` requests

```js
/**
 * An example showing how to debounce input events and cancel pending fetch
 * requests to avoid a high input delay from rapid input events.
 */
const input = document.querySelector("input");
let controller;
let signal;
let timeoutId;

const handler = async (e) => {
  // Cancel any pending requests.
  if (controller) {
    controller.abort();
  }

  controller = new AbortController();
  signal = controller.signal;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`?q=${e.target.value}`, {
      signal,
    });
    // ...remaining callback logic
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.name === "AbortError") {
      // Ignore "errors" from canceled requests.
      return;
    }

    throw err;
  }
};

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  // Cancel any pending callbacks.
  clearTimeout(timeoutId);

  // Wait 50 ms before executing callbacks.
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => handler(e), 50);
});
```

### Inefficient animations

When animating elements, try to only animate `transform` and `opacity` CSS
properties so the
[animation doesn't run on the main thread](https://www.nray.dev/blog/using-chrome-profiler-to-fix-performance-issues/#animations-that-run-on-the-main-thread),
which can cause an input delay.

## Optimize processing time

Slow event callbacks will mitigate any positive effects of an optimized input
delay. Fortunately, you can make optimizations to ensure this doesn't happen.

import inpProcessingTime from "./_assets/inp-processing-time.png";

<Image
  src={inpProcessingTime}
  alt="Interaction timeline highlighting the processing time portion."
  caption="Processing time  measures how long it takes the browser to execute event callbacks."
/>

### Long tasks from JavaScript execution

One of the most common reasons for a high processing time is JavaScript that
**takes too long to execute**. This results in a long task on the main thread
that delays important rendering updates.

import inpLongTask from "./_assets/inp-long-task-processing-time.png";

<Image
  caption="The execution of event handlers like this click handler can cause long tasks on the main thread."
  src={inpLongTask}
  alt="Chrome's performance profiler showing a long task from a click callback."
/>

How do we solve this?

First, investigate the JavaScript responsible for the long task and see if there
is any low-hanging fruit. Sometimes, this will reveal
[**unnecessary JS that can be removed**](/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/#step-1-remove-unnecessary-javascript)
or
[**inefficient JS that can be optimized**](/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/#step-2-optimize-existing-javascript).
You may also be able to move some JavaScript off the main thread with
[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API),
which will free up the main thread to handle interactions.

After reducing JavaScript work, the next best option is to **yield to the main
thread**. Split up the work into **smaller tasks** that each take less than **50
ms** to execute. And prioritize the work that is user-facing. The benefits of
doing this are two-fold:

1. It allows the browser to render user-visible work as quickly as possible in
   the next frame, providing the user with fast visual feedback that _something_
   has happened.
2. Deferring non-essential work to another task in a `setTimeout` callback
   allows the main thread to handle higher priority tasks like subsequent user
   input _before_ the `setTimeout`callback is executed. Alternatively, you could
   use
   [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback),
   but note that it has much less
   [browser support](https://caniuse.com/requestidlecallback).

```js
accordion.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  // Critical user-visible work that needs to happen before next frame.
  toggleSection(event);

  // Defer less important work to the next frame in another task.
  requesetAnimationFrame(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      updateAnalytics(event);
    });
  });
});
```

### Layout Thrashing

**The order of your JavaScript calls can dramatically influence how long it
takes to execute**.

If your JS reads
[layout properties](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a)
after modifying styles, the browser needs to perform a
[forced synchronous layout](https://www.nray.dev/blog/using-chrome-profiler-to-fix-performance-issues/#forced-synchronous-layouts)
to determine the updated layout metrics.

```js
// Write
section.classList.add("expanded");
// Read (causing a forced synchronous layout)
section.scrollHeight;
```

This order becomes particularly expensive if you invoke multiple forced
synchronous before the browser presents a frame. When this happens, it's called
“[layout thrashing](/blog/using-chrome-profiler-to-fix-performance-issues/#layout-thrashing)"
and can significantly increase processing time. Layout thrashing often happens
when a read and write are inside a loop:

```js
const sections = documet.querySelectorAll("section");

// Each iteration causes a forced synchronous layout that results in layout
// thrashing.
sections.forEach((element) => {
  // Write
  section.classList.add("expanded");
  // Read (causing a forced synchronous layout)
  section.scrollHeight;
});
```

To eliminate forced synchronous layouts and layout thrashing, **perform all
reads before any writes**:

```js
const sections = documet.querySelectorAll("section");

// Perform all reads first.
sections.forEach((element) => {
  // Read
  section.scrollHeight;
});

// Then perform all writes.
sections.forEach((element) => {
  // Write
  section.classList.add("expanded");
});
```

## Optimize presentation delay

The last phase that can go wrong is the presentation delay portion which
involves rendering and presenting the visual changes. It's also one of the most
challenging phases to optimize.

import inpPresentationDelay from "./_assets/inp-presentation-delay.png";

<Image
  src={inpPresentationDelay}
  alt="Interaction timeline highlighting the presentation delay portion."
  caption="Presentation delay  measures how long it takes the browser to render, paint, and composite a visual update."
/>

### Large DOM size

Significant presentation delays are often the result of large DOM trees — pages
with more than **1,500 elements**. The rendering work that the browser must do
to produce a frame correlates with the size of the DOM.

Generally, **the larger the DOM size, the longer it takes for the browser to
render updates**.

To minimize the effects of a large DOM size, you can hide certain elements by
default with one of the following methods, effectively removing the rendering
costs:

- `display: none` CSS style
- [`hidden=until-found`](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/hidden-until-found/)
  HTML attribute

An excellent approach to improve the performance of long accordion sections is
to hide the sections that are not open using one of the above methods. Hiding
the sections removes them from the browser's rendering tree, reducing
presentation delay.

When a user interacts with a closed accordion section, such as by clicking it,
you can programmatically show the hidden element. Although this will add it back
to the rendering tree and cause some delay, it's more efficient than the
alternative of rendering _all_ the sections (unless the user toggles all
sections). Wikipedia uses this technique on its mobile site for most sections of
an article.

import hiddenUntilFound from "./_assets/wikipedia-mobile-hidden-until-found-attribute.png";

<Image
  src={hiddenUntilFound}
  alt={`Screenshot of Wikipedia's mobile site showing many collapsed article sections. Chrome DevTools shows that a "hidden=until-found" attribute hides most of the sections.`}
  caption={`Wikipedia's mobile site uses the \`hidden="until-found"\` attribute to hide most of the article's sections by default, helping reduce the page's presentation delay.`}
/>

A more advanced technique involves using the
[`content-visibility: auto`](https://web.dev/content-visibility/) CSS style to
lazily render off-screen elements.

## Conclusion

Whew! That was a lot. In summary:

- INP measures the responsiveness of clicks, key presses, and taps on
  touchscreens to produce visual updates
- INP will become a Core Web Vital on March 2024, replacing FID
- INP is best measured with real user monitoring. Start with
  [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- Slow interactions are the result of long tasks on the main thread
- Efforts to optimize INP need to consider each interaction's input delay,
  processing time, and presentation delay

Focusing solely on achieving a perfect INP score can be overwhelming. But it's
important to maintain sight of the main objective — a more responsive website
leads to happier users and better business outcomes.
